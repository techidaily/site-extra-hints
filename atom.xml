Knowing the characteristics about aspect ratios is crucial to accomplish the ideal visual appeal across any platform.</p><p>If you want to learn more about video aspect ratios, how to apply them to different social media platforms, then you are in the right place! This article will explain what a video aspect ratio is, it includes common video aspect ratios you see nowadays, and includes recommended aspect ratios for video on various social media platforms.</p><p>With that said, let’s dive right into it!</p><h2 id="1-What-is-a-video-aspect-ratio"><a href="#1-What-is-a-video-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="1. What is a video aspect ratio?"></a>1. What is a video aspect ratio?</h2><p>Aspect ratio is a digital image projection attribute describing the distance between the width and the height of an image. The dimensions are also defined as shapes such as a square which is 4:3. A rectangle represents the 16:9 standard high definition aspect ratio, and inverted what you see on phones, that will be 9:16. 9 refers to the width and 16 to the height.</p><h2 id="2-Commonly-used-aspect-ratios"><a href="#2-Commonly-used-aspect-ratios" class="headerlink" title="2. Commonly used aspect ratios"></a>2. Commonly used aspect ratios</h2><p>There is no same aspect ratio that is used across all social media platforms. Depending on which social media platform you are planning to upload, you have to make sure you have the correct aspect ratio for your target audience. The optimal viewing experience is what matters.</p><h3 id="16-9-Widescreen"><a href="#16-9-Widescreen" class="headerlink" title="16:9 Widescreen"></a>16:9 Widescreen</h3><p>This aspect ratio is recognized as the worldwide reference format for film, mobile devides, DSLR cameras, streaming platforms, social media platforms, and many more. It is known as landscape viewing which include 720p, 1080p HD and 4K resolution.</p><h3 id="4-3-Standard"><a href="#4-3-Standard" class="headerlink" title="4:3 Standard"></a>4:3 Standard</h3><p>This resolution is originally used in older television screens, which transformed into mobile use as this aspect ratio works really well for Instagram and Facebook videos, referring to the 9:16 phone resolution making a square video more pleasant to watch and to be featured in in-feed videos.</p><h3 id="9-16-Vertical"><a href="#9-16-Vertical" class="headerlink" title="9:16 Vertical"></a>9:16 Vertical</h3><p>The 9:16 aspect ratio has become the mainstream resolution for smartphones for easier viewing of videos. This resolution allows for the vertical display of videos on tablets and phones, meaning that it allows videos to play while the device is being held in its upright position. This works ideally for Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube Shorts, and more.</p><h3 id="21-9-Cinematic-Widescreen"><a href="#21-9-Cinematic-Widescreen" class="headerlink" title="21:9 Cinematic Widescreen"></a>21:9 Cinematic Widescreen</h3><p>The 21:9 resolution is designed for filming ultra-wide screen movies that gives the viewer a theater-like feeling. It’s mostly used to display films and movies in anamorphic formats. Just like on ultra-wide monitors, it allows the video to be shown across the entire screen, giving you a cinema-like experience. This resolution contributes to a broader viewing experience in any shape or form.</p><h2 id="3-Which-aspect-ratio-should-I-choose"><a href="#3-Which-aspect-ratio-should-I-choose" class="headerlink" title="3. Which aspect ratio should I choose?"></a>3. Which aspect ratio should I choose?</h2><p>Depending on your project, broadcast location and filming options, here you can find an overview of which platforms are using which resolutions and how you can use that to improve your filming and viewer experience.</p><h3 id="Facebook"><a href="#Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Facebook"></a>Facebook</h3><p>Facebook is one of the most used website across the world on both computer and the mobile app. This is a great platform to let people discover your content. In order to please new viewers, let’s look at the resolutions Facebook supports and which one would be your best option depending on your content.</p><p>4:3 or 1:1 for Facebook feed videos</p><p>16:9 for in-stream ads on Facebook</p><p>9:16 for Facebook live videos</p><p>9:16 for Facebook stories</p><h3 id="YouTube"><a href="#YouTube" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h3><p>To this day, it’s safe to say that YouTube is the leading platform in the video industry. Not only because of how long they have been around, but also about how much content is uploaded every minute and how many users it has each month. To give the viewers the best experience, here are the top aspect ratios we recommend when posting content onto your YouTube channel.</p><p>16:9 for YouTube live streams</p><p>9:16 for YouTube Shorts</p><p>16:9 for regular HD videos</p><p>21:9 for cinematic videos&#x2F;shortfilms</p><h3 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h3><p>When talking about Instagram, which is very similar to Facebook, use these aspect ratios to ensure that your quality will be the best of the best.</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Reels</p><p>4:3 for Instagram feed advertisements</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Story advertisements</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Stories</p><p>4:3 or 1:1 for Instagram feed videos</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Live streams</p><p>9:16 for IGTV</p><h3 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h3><p>Before Musical.ly users were migrated to a new platform called TikTok in 2018, it has been the leader on the board for a long time, and here are the recommended resolutions we think give the best results. Tik Tok allows you to share short videos, and is used by young people as an outlet to show their talents whether it’s dancing, singing, cooking, comedy or any other form of entertainment they can express and use on the platform. There’s also a feature to work together and collaborate with other Tik Tok creators across the globe.</p><p>16:9 for organic Tik Tok feed videos</p><p>16:9 for Tik Tok live videos</p><p>1:1; 16:9 or 9:16 for TikTok advertisements</p><h2 id="4-How-to-adjust-the-aspect-ratio-of-a-video"><a href="#4-How-to-adjust-the-aspect-ratio-of-a-video" class="headerlink" title="4. How to adjust the aspect ratio of a video?"></a>4. How to adjust the aspect ratio of a video?</h2><p>A very important point we’d like to mention is that we don’t recommend changing the aspect ratio after filming, because it could harm the video quality and we think it’s best to choose the aspect ratio on your phone or camera before filming, besides that we have some great tips for optimizing your video for the watching experience below.</p><h3 id="Black-bars"><a href="#Black-bars" class="headerlink" title="Black bars"></a>Black bars</h3><p>When editing your video, adding black bars is not changing the aspect ratio as you are just adding black bars to the screen. What we do recommend is cropping the video until you get the desired result. Adding black bars won’t automatically make the platform adjust the video and it will affect the viewer experience.</p><h3 id="Cropping"><a href="#Cropping" class="headerlink" title="Cropping"></a>Cropping</h3><p>Cropping your video will allow you to remove a section from your video, which works perfect for unwanted objects or people. While cropping the video, you are forced to pick the essential part of your video and disregard the rest of the video and to remove distraction from the frame.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Having your video tested on multiple devices will allow you to see a preview of what the viewer will see and make necessary changes if needed. When your video looks perfect, you can be sure that it will give a seamless experience across all platforms, without the fear of losing video quality.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p></article[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)For macOS 10.14 or later<p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-titles-google-cardboards-most-immersive-vr-games-for-2024/"><u>Best Titles  Google Cardboard's Most Immersive VR Games for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/mastering-discretion-in-digital-artistry/"><u>Mastering Discretion in Digital Artistry</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/choosing-your-videos-ultimate-shape-for-2024/"><u>Choosing Your Video's Ultimate Shape for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-complete-motion-evaluation-2023/"><u>2024 Approved  Complete Motion Evaluation 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-secrets-of-smooth-telegram-web-use/"><u>Unveiling the Secrets of Smooth Telegram Web Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-beyond-the-screen-ultimate-vr-gadget-guide/"><u>[New] Beyond the Screen - Ultimate VR Gadget Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-brightness-and-hd-in-harmony-a-fit-for-hdr/"><u>[Updated] Brightness and HD in Harmony  A Fit for HDR?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-perfect-recorder-chromebooks-best-friend/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Perfect Recorder  Chromebook's Best Friend</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-replace-sony-vegas-with-these-powerful-windows-video-editing-tools-for-2024/"><u>Updated Replace Sony Vegas with These Powerful Windows Video Editing Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-novatech-series-unified-4k-all-in-one-workstations/"><u>[New] NovaTech Series  Unified 4K, All-in-One Workstations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-effective-ways-to-easily-convert-vtt-to-srt/"><u>In 2024, 2 Effective Ways to Easily Convert VTT to SRT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-quintessential-10-fight-royale-games-for-2024/"><u>[New] Quintessential 10 Fight Royale Games for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/fixed-were-sorry-but-excel-has-run-into-an-error-stellar-by-stellar-guide/"><u>Fixed Were Sorry But Excel Has Run into an Error | Stellar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-master-money-makers-the-best-of-the-top-ig-earners/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Master Money Makers  The Best of the Top IG Earners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/audio-synthesis-in-film-the-2023-process-of-capturing-and-adding-vocal-talent-to-visuals-for-2024/"><u>Audio Synthesis in Film The 2023 Process of Capturing and Adding Vocal Talent to Visuals for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Crafting-the-Perfect-Visual-Identity-Podcast-Covers-Unveiled"><a href="#Crafting-the-Perfect-Visual-Identity-Podcast-Covers-Unveiled" class="headerlink" title="Crafting the Perfect Visual Identity: Podcast Covers Unveiled"></a>Crafting the Perfect Visual Identity: Podcast Covers Unveiled</h2><p>Research suggests people make up their mind within 90 seconds after the initial interaction with the brand and associate it as either bad or good. Many podcasters only focus on the podcast’s content, which they should, but ignore the visual identity of the podcast.</p><p>In this guide, we will guide you to design a stunning and unique podcast cover. But before that, we will acquaint you with all the necessary elements of an eye-catching podcast cover image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast cover image"                ></p><h2 id="Round-Up-10-Tips-to-Design-Podcast-Cover-Art"><a href="#Round-Up-10-Tips-to-Design-Podcast-Cover-Art" class="headerlink" title="Round-Up 10 Tips to Design Podcast Cover Art"></a>Round-Up 10 Tips to Design Podcast Cover Art</h2><p>These are not tips but 101 guides on podcast cover-making. All the ten key points mentioned here will enable you to create a podcast cover image that stands out and catch the user’s attention.</p><h3 id="1-Make-sure-the-podcast-cover-meets-podcast-platform-requirements"><a href="#1-Make-sure-the-podcast-cover-meets-podcast-platform-requirements" class="headerlink" title="1. Make sure the podcast cover meets podcast platform requirements"></a>1. Make sure the podcast cover meets podcast platform requirements</h3><p>To make your podcast accessible to people worldwide, you have to publish them to podcast platforms, otherwise known as podcast directories. For instance, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts are podcast directories.</p><p>The good thing is most podcast directories have a similar requirement for the podcast cover art dimensions, resolution, and file type. Still, some podcast directories have special needs. So, ensure to know the requirement of each podcast directory that you plan to publish your podcasts on and select the canvas accordingly.</p><p>For instance, the podcast cover size demanded by Apple Podcast is:</p><ul><li>3000 x 3000 pixels</li><li>Resolution of 72 dpi</li><li>JPG or PNG file type</li><li>RGB color-space</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-2.jpg"                      alt="apple podcast cover image"                ></p><p>Google Podcasts, a popular podcast platform among Android users, also has the same or similar requirements for the podcast cover image. That is to say, you do not have to design a podcast cover exclusive to Google Podcasts.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are some platforms that have different requirements. For instance, Spotify mentions the following need for a podcast cover image:</p><ul><li>TIFF, PNG, or JPG format using loss-less encoding</li><li>The highest resolution available</li><li>At least 640px wide and tall</li><li>1:1 aspect ratio</li><li>Encoded with an sRGB color space, 24bits per pixel, with color profiles applied directly.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: The thing to remember is to design podcast covers for all platforms with different requirements. It may seem daunting, but limitations and provisions often unleash a person’s creativity. Needless to say, if you are a professional podcaster and your teammates responsible for podcast cover making, then you can leave it to them.</p><h3 id="2-Straight-to-the-point"><a href="#2-Straight-to-the-point" class="headerlink" title="2. Straight to the point"></a>2. Straight to the point</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-3.jpg"                      alt="podcast straight to the point image"                ></p><p>People often confuse “straight to the point” with plain and simple. However, it is an unjust explanation of what is straight to the point. Additionally, achieving the “straight to the point” scale is not simple.</p><p>Put, “straight to the point” means something that best projects your podcast theme with a user who has never even engaged with your podcast. For instance, if your podcast discusses movies, then do not simply design a podcast cover with the blockbuster sign.</p><p>Instead, brainstorm ideas for what you often differ in the podcast, like a specific genre or movie series. Once you narrow down the ideas, you can design a podcast cover that is straight to the point, i.e., it conveys the message creatively.</p><p>Here are some examples to help you think in the “straight to the point” fashion:</p><p><strong>Example #1 ― Entrepreneurs like it simple, plain, and sophisticated.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-4.jpg"                      alt="podcast straight to the point image"                ></p><p>The above podcast cover designs are related to business. If you carefully review each of them, you will find the human element. The human element is a necessary factor in business-related podcasts. It is what allows business professionals to connect with the experts and attracts them to the podcasts.</p><p>Another thing to review is the color palettes used by the entrepreneurs. The colors used in the podcast cover photos by hosts are often subtle yet bright and reek of sophistication.</p><p><strong>Example #2 ― Comedians Making the Most from Their Podcast Cover Photos.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-5.jpg"                      alt="podcast comedy covers"                ></p><p>Comedy podcasts don’t seem like much, but they have a huge user following. Do you know how? Well, they attract users in bulk with their funky, impressive, and immersive cover images. Notice the clever use of colors on all the podcast cover designs. Moreover, the typography used in these cover images is also unsophisticated and often conveys that this isn’t something serious.</p><h3 id="3-Avoid-Inappropriate-Words-or-Imagery"><a href="#3-Avoid-Inappropriate-Words-or-Imagery" class="headerlink" title="3. Avoid Inappropriate Words or Imagery"></a>3. Avoid Inappropriate Words or Imagery</h3><p>Swearing and inappropriate imagery is part of today’s taboo culture. However, it offends users. You have to retain that the podcast-listening community is an informed one. It’s not about becoming cool, but it’s about delivering cool information.</p><p>Not to mention, using explicit languages is also restricted by podcast directories, like Apple Podcast and Spotify. So, you may also get banned for using offensive words or imagery in your podcast cover photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-6.jpg"                      alt="podcast explicit covers"                ></p><p>The recent policies of podcast directories like Apple Podcast have changed drastically. For instance, you could have gotten away with using asterisk marks in some words (like sh*t); however, it is not the case today. Your podcast will receive multiple notifications from the platform managers to remove the banner, and in some cases, the directories can also ban you from the platform. So, it is best to play it safe and use professional language, at least in the podcast cover photos.</p><h3 id="4-Color-Matters"><a href="#4-Color-Matters" class="headerlink" title="4. Color Matters"></a>4. Color Matters</h3><p>There are trends in book cover design and movie cover design, and then comes the trends in podcast cover design. You will be surprised to know the amount of time each podcaster spent on deciding the right color for the cover art.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-7.jpg"                      alt="podcast colors covers"                ></p><p>Color is something that not many businesses pay attention to, but it has a profound effect on users. To just give you an example of how deep businesses think about the color of their business, there is a separate domain after colors: color branding.</p><p>Yes, businesses spent a lot of brainstorming sessions to combine color theory and business. Here are some of the most prominent trends in the podcast world today and their significance:</p><p><strong>Example # 1. Red background with light text</strong></p><p>If you are into sales, you might already be familiar with the concept of red. Basically, red is the color of love, excitement, and anger. And the combination of these emotions allows businesses to create a sense of urgency among users. You can use the same psychology in the podcast world and let new users discover you through this psychological trick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-8.jpg"                      alt="podcast red covers"                ></p><p>Today, almost all domains in the podcast world use the red color and combine it with black or white text to entice users about their podcast episodes. You can find such podcast covers on topics ranging from history to anthropology, psychology to music, and so on.</p><p><strong>Example #2. Blue background with light text</strong></p><p>Blue is the color of trust, competency, and quality. To loosely translate its psychological effects on an average human, blue creates a sense of dependability, logic, and peace. So, if your podcast is on medical topics or something calm, a blue podcast cover photo is the way to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-9.jpg"                      alt="podcast blue covers"                ></p><p>There are numerous other examples like this. For instance, even black ink on a grey palette is a trend. After studying their psychological effects on your users, you can choose from any number of colors and combinations.</p><p>It is important to retain that color psychology is not about tricking people. Instead, it is about learning the effects of color on people mind’s and using one that best describes your episodes. So, research this in-depth and choose a color that resonates with your content and also impresses users.</p><h3 id="5-Typography-will-help"><a href="#5-Typography-will-help" class="headerlink" title="5. Typography will help"></a>5. Typography will help</h3><p>A debate that long started at the advent of the internet and is still continuing is the effects of fonts on readability. Some recent <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/learn/serif-vs-sans-serif-fonts/" >studies from Canva have revealed that fonts have a lot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to do with readability. But most important of all, fonts have a huge effect on people’s emotions.</p><p>For instance, serif fonts have long been used in newspapers, magazines, and even web pages. That is why most users associate serif fonts with classical, nostalgic, and often professional or formal. And it is thus suitable when you are creating a professional podcast discussing business, education, and so on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-10.jpg"                      alt="podcast typography covers"                ></p><p>Sans serif is the new thing. It is all about throwing the tradition of using Serif fonts out of the window and using a fun and exciting and allowing users to read conveniently on the web-pages.</p><p>But typography does not mean it’s all about the font itself. The size of the font, the spaces in between the fonts, and the color of the font all play a differential role. So, ensure to learn about all the intricacies of typography and accordingly use fonts, their size, the gap in between them, their color, and so on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-11.jpg"                      alt="podcast typography blendcovers"                ></p><p>Additionally, you should focus on blending the typography with imagery. The combination of both often becomes messy and unreadable; of course, the creativity lies in</p><h3 id="6-Unique-and-high-resolution-images"><a href="#6-Unique-and-high-resolution-images" class="headerlink" title="6. Unique and high-resolution images"></a>6. Unique and high-resolution images</h3><p>A unique picture is what differentiates you from others. A user can easily locate and revisit your episodes if you use a unique-looking podcast cover. However, in addition to the unique design of the podcast cover, you should also ensure it is in high resolution.</p><p>Retain that a high-resolution picture speaks about class, professionalism, and sophistication, regardless of what you discuss in the podcast. At the same time, a low-resolution podcast is unsuitable and looks un-classy in the digital era.</p><h3 id="7-Brand-consistency"><a href="#7-Brand-consistency" class="headerlink" title="7. Brand consistency"></a>7. Brand consistency</h3><p>Of course, A&#x2F;B testing in the initial phases is necessary to test the design of the podcast cover. However, such tests are suitable for a short period of time. Ensure to spend enough time beforehand, so you do not have to change the design of the podcast cover often.</p><p>Brands like Coca-Cola, Nike, and Apple use consistency in their images and logos and ensure that all platforms have a similar brand image. This allows the users to recognize the brand, and the picture sits in the user’s mind. So, ensure consistency across all platforms and use the same cover images on all podcast directories.</p><h3 id="8-Image-compression"><a href="#8-Image-compression" class="headerlink" title="8. Image compression"></a>8. Image compression</h3><p>Almost all podcast directories will recommend you compress the podcast cover image, and for good reasons. Firstly, a small image loads faster on the pages and allows users to interact with your podcast at first sight. Second, mobile apps and web pages are very different in nature from web platforms. And a lot of users listen to the podcast via their smart phones, so it is best to use compressed images.</p><p>An ideal podcast cover art dimension is 3000 x 3000 pixels, which is a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Some podcast platforms, like Buzzsprout, do the image compression on their end. So, ensure not to compress the image beforehand, as this will further shrink the size of the image.</p><h3 id="9-Design-for-a-variety-of-sizes-and-re-purpose-your-art"><a href="#9-Design-for-a-variety-of-sizes-and-re-purpose-your-art" class="headerlink" title="9. Design for a variety of sizes and re-purpose your art"></a>9. Design for a variety of sizes and re-purpose your art</h3><p>When you design the podcast cover, it is best to take different aspect ratios and dimensions and sketch your plan. This will allow you to be more creative, and of course, you can easily resize the banner for respective podcast directories.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Make-an-Attractive-Podcast-Cover-Easily-with-Filmora"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Make-an-Attractive-Podcast-Cover-Easily-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Make an Attractive Podcast Cover Easily with Filmora"></a>Bonus Tip: Make an Attractive Podcast Cover Easily with Filmora</h2><p>Now that you know how to choose color, font, typography, and content for the podcast cover art, let’s learn how to combine all these elements and design a podcast cover that is unique, different, and impressive.</p><p>However, using an effective tool like Filmora to design podcast covers is important.

Our today’s topic is exciting as it’s how you can <strong>write a good documentary script</strong> for your documentary video or film. As all of us know, the script is fundamental for any screenplay as it contains all the dialogues and instructions for the actors in written form. So that’s why it is also essential for your audio or video documentaries. That’s the reason why we are going to discuss this topic here today how you can be able to write effectively.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Literary Style</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Shot-Oriented</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Shooting Script</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to make your own movie</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Ensure the authenticity of the story</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">Define the key issues</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-3">Highlight the characteristics of the scene</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-4">Visual Writing</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-5">Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-6">Fully researched</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Documentary script examples</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Make your documentary script come true by using Filmora</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Documentary"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Documentary" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is a Documentary?"></a>Part 1. What is a Documentary?</h2><p>To write a good documentary script, you should first know what a documentary is. A documentary is a genre usually used for non-fiction or reality-based films. Such type of films includes researched based representation of a specific subject like interviews of peoples involved in it, official documents related to it, and many more. Sometimes they tell us facts about a particular topic that only very few of us know. They are also beneficial to raising social issues to the officials and making others aware of them. Now that you know what a documentary is let’s move forward to our next step, three popular types of documentary scripts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script"><a href="#Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Three popular types of a documentary script"></a>Part 2. Three popular types of a documentary script</h2><h3 id="1-Literary-Style"><a href="#1-Literary-Style" class="headerlink" title="1. Literary Style"></a>1. Literary Style</h3><p>In this style, your only concerns are with the shooting ability of the text for which you should have camera sense, writing rhetorically (but not too much) with the text language literacy, and dividing the script into different paragraphs according to time space and scene. You don’t have to describe the technical requirements of shooting in it.</p><h3 id="2-Shot-Oriented"><a href="#2-Shot-Oriented" class="headerlink" title="2. Shot-Oriented"></a>2. Shot-Oriented</h3><p>In this one, you have to write a detailed description of the action and the images which will be there in your screenplay without considering the script’s literary merits and readability. Also, in this style, each scene is divided into paragraphs, and before starting each section, the writer should have mentioned the scene’s location, time, mirror, and number. In simple words, this script style provides more detailed and deep instructions about the film or a documentary screenplay.</p><h3 id="3-Shooting-Script"><a href="#3-Shooting-Script" class="headerlink" title="3. Shooting Script"></a>3. Shooting Script</h3><p>The director usually uses this style of scripting. After the director of the film or the documentary, the screenplay reads the literary script. He writes a subordinate storyline, including the picture image and the sound, which he is agreed to represent in his film or documentary screenplay.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script"><a href="#Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Six basic theoretical knowledge about documentary script"></a>Part 3. Six basic theoretical knowledge about documentary script</h2><h3 id="1-Ensure-the-authenticity-of-the-story"><a href="#1-Ensure-the-authenticity-of-the-story" class="headerlink" title="1. Ensure the authenticity of the story"></a>1. Ensure the authenticity of the story</h3><p>The first and most important step in writing a documentary screenplay is to make sure the material and information you use is accurate. Moreover, if your documentary script is based on a true story, you should first confirm the veracity of the tale before drafting the script. It elevates the level of your script’s content quality.</p><h3 id="2-Define-the-key-issues"><a href="#2-Define-the-key-issues" class="headerlink" title="2. Define the key issues"></a>2. Define the key issues</h3><p>Another thing that makes a documentary script best is that it should define the critical issues of the topic upon which it relies. For example, writing a documentary script on a social problem, you should also define its key points. Also, you can add interviews of the experts, or the people involved in some story. It makes your documentary script more effective and influential for the audience.</p><h3 id="3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene"><a href="#3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene" class="headerlink" title="3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene"></a>3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene</h3><p>Highlighting the characteristics of each scene of your script makes it much better and easy for others to understand. For example, if you have any fighting scene in your documentary film, you should have to define each thing that will be there and film it in your screenplay. Also, you can suggest or specify the location of each scene.</p><h3 id="4-Visual-Writing"><a href="#4-Visual-Writing" class="headerlink" title="4. Visual Writing"></a>4. Visual Writing</h3><p>Visual Writing means you should make it clear in your script which will be there in a specific scene. Moreover, it would be best if you also described your character’s situation.

What is a Documentary?"></a>Part 1. What is a Documentary?</h2><p>To write a good documentary script, you should first know what a documentary is. A documentary is a genre usually used for non-fiction or reality-based films. Such type of films includes researched based representation of a specific subject like interviews of peoples involved in it, official documents related to it, and many more. Sometimes they tell us facts about a particular topic that only very few of us know. They are also beneficial to raising social issues to the officials and making others aware of them. Now that you know what a documentary is let’s move forward to our next step, three popular types of documentary scripts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script-1"><a href="#Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Three popular types of a documentary script"></a>Part 2. Three popular types of a documentary script</h2><h3 id="1-Literary-Style-1"><a href="#1-Literary-Style-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Literary Style"></a>1. Literary Style</h3><p>In this style, your only concerns are with the shooting ability of the text for which you should have camera sense, writing rhetorically (but not too much) with the text language literacy, and dividing the script into different paragraphs according to time space and scene. You don’t have to describe the technical requirements of shooting in it.</p><h3 id="2-Shot-Oriented-1"><a href="#2-Shot-Oriented-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Shot-Oriented"></a>2. Shot-Oriented</h3><p>In this one, you have to write a detailed description of the action and the images which will be there in your screenplay without considering the script’s literary merits and readability. Also, in this style, each scene is divided into paragraphs, and before starting each section, the writer should have mentioned the scene’s location, time, mirror, and number. In simple words, this script style provides more detailed and deep instructions about the film or a documentary screenplay.</p><h3 id="3-Shooting-Script-1"><a href="#3-Shooting-Script-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Shooting Script"></a>3. Shooting Script</h3><p>The director usually uses this style of scripting. After the director of the film or the documentary, the screenplay reads the literary script. He writes a subordinate storyline, including the picture image and the sound, which he is agreed to represent in his film or documentary screenplay.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script-1"><a href="#Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Ensure the authenticity of the story"></a>1. Ensure the authenticity of the story</h3><p>The first and most important step in writing a documentary screenplay is to make sure the material and information you use is accurate. Moreover, if your documentary script is based on a true story, you should first confirm the veracity of the tale before drafting the script. It elevates the level of your script’s content quality.</p><h3 id="2-Define-the-key-issues-1"><a href="#2-Define-the-key-issues-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Define the key issues"></a>2. Define the key issues</h3><p>Another thing that makes a documentary script best is that it should define the critical issues of the topic upon which it relies. For example, writing a documentary script on a social problem, you should also define its key points. Also, you can add interviews of the experts, or the people involved in some story. It makes your documentary script more effective and influential for the audience.</p><h3 id="3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene-1"><a href="#3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene"></a>3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene</h3><p>Highlighting the characteristics of each scene of your script makes it much better and easy for others to understand. For example, if you have any fighting scene in your documentary film, you should have to define each thing that will be there and film it in your screenplay. Also, you can suggest or specify the location of each scene.</p><h3 id="4-Visual-Writing-1"><a href="#4-Visual-Writing-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Visual Writing"></a>4. Visual Writing</h3><p>Visual Writing means you should make it clear in your script which will be there in a specific scene. Moreover, it would be best if you also described your character’s situation. It is the most necessary thing in a documentary script, so you should never take it side.</p><h3 id="5-Guaranteed-documentary-viewing-Rhythm-1"><a href="#5-Guaranteed-documentary-viewing-Rhythm-1" class="headerlink" title="5.

The  baseline is your best bet in general.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Adjust the resolution and Export the file.</strong></p><p>You can change the resolution or aspect ratio variables to change the video’s size.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/64gb-128gb-hold-video-size-6.jpg"                      alt="64gb-128gb-hold-video-size"                ></p><h3 id="2-Veed-io-3"><a href="#2-Veed-io-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

VEED provides a simple video compression tool for free as part of its video editing tools. It works on both Windows and Mac, and it runs entirely within your browser, so no software is required.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import file:</strong></p><p>Open the web browser and open the veed.io video compressor.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Crafting-Visual-Magic-Advanced-Tips-for-Stunning-Edits"><a href="#Crafting-Visual-Magic-Advanced-Tips-for-Stunning-Edits" class="headerlink" title="Crafting Visual Magic: Advanced Tips for Stunning Edits"></a>Crafting Visual Magic: Advanced Tips for Stunning Edits</h2><p>Post-processing is an essential tool in photography, using which you can create the look you want on your images. Regardless of your sharp photography skills or how perfect the shot is, images are almost always incomplete without editing. As an aspiring photographer, there are a few editing tips and hacks you should know to make the process easier and worthwhile.</p><p>To help you bring out the best in your photos, the following article contains some helpful photography editing tips. You can follow these techniques to create stunning images seamlessly.</p><h2 id="Part-1-10-Photography-Editing-Tips-for-Creating-Amazing-Photos"><a href="#Part-1-10-Photography-Editing-Tips-for-Creating-Amazing-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 10 Photography Editing Tips for Creating Amazing Photos"></a>Part 1: 10 Photography Editing Tips for Creating Amazing Photos</h2><p>Image editing is virtually an inevitable need these days. Numerous photography editing software are available to help enhance your images in multiple ways. These apps come laden with valuable features to help you create remarkable photos. But it is all in vain if you do not know how to utilize these tools properly.</p><p>To assist you in this regard, we have compiled a list of 10 effective photography editing tips and tricks. These are bound to prove fruitful in helping you bring your creative visions to life.</p><h3 id="1-Cropping-Can-Help"><a href="#1-Cropping-Can-Help" class="headerlink" title="1. Cropping Can Help"></a>1. Cropping Can Help</h3><p>One of the most important aspects of a photo is its framing and composition. While capturing an image, you might be paying close attention to every corner in the frame. Still, there might come times when things can get a little out of hand.</p><p>Luckily, every photography editing software offers the primary crop tool. You can easily omit unnecessary parts of your image with a few simple clicks. You can also seek help from a grid to ensure that your subject is in the center of the frame. Thus, you can add a symmetrical look to your images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-1.jpg"                      alt="crop the image"                ></p><h3 id="2-Presets-are-your-Friends"><a href="#2-Presets-are-your-Friends" class="headerlink" title="2. Presets are your Friends"></a>2. Presets are your Friends</h3><p>When processing multiple images at once, the editing process can be tiring and bothersome. To help you out, most photography editing software comes with a range of presets and tools you can apply to your photos. If all your images need similar changes, these presets can come in handy. You can also create the perfect combination of settings yourself and apply them instantly.</p><p> Image name: photography-editing-tips-2.jpg” alt&#x3D;”manga black white effect” class&#x3D;”img-fluid” &#x2F;&gt;</p><p>Image alt: use presets for image editing</p><h3 id="3-Play-With-the-Colors"><a href="#3-Play-With-the-Colors" class="headerlink" title="3. Play With the Colors"></a>3. Play With the Colors</h3><p>If you look around closely, you can find that everything is associated with a specific color. From the lush green grass to the vibrant dreamy blue skies, everything has its shade. But upon closer inspection, you will find that it’s not just a single constituent color. The grass’s green contains shades of yellow, brown, and orange too.</p><p>If you train your eye to see these hidden colors, you can easily make your images pop. Under the right lighting, you can see the various shades underlying seemingly monochromatic things. You can play with these colors using simple color grading techniques to bring a more vibrant look to your image. Adjust the vibrancy, saturation, and tint until you get the look you want in your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-3.jpg"                      alt="play with the image colors"                ></p><h3 id="4-Adjust-the-Contrast"><a href="#4-Adjust-the-Contrast" class="headerlink" title="4. Adjust the Contrast"></a>4. Adjust the Contrast</h3><p>One of the main reasons your images are looking flat is low contrast. Without a clear difference between foregrounds and backgrounds, the image can seemingly lack focus. You can play with the blacks and whites to adjust the contrast in your photo. Some of the best photography editing software offers a contrast slider that can help refine your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-4.jpg"                      alt="adjust the image contrast"                ></p><h3 id="5-Try-Overlays"><a href="#5-Try-Overlays" class="headerlink" title="5. Try Overlays"></a>5. Try Overlays</h3><p>Layering different textures and images to your photo is a great way to create visual interest in your image. Overlays are easy and helpful tools that are present in nearly all photography editing apps. You can use these to set the mood and create your desired atmosphere in the image.</p><p>Overlays are also useful for creating double exposure effects in your image. If you want to highlight some specific part of your photo, you can do it by adding a simple overlay. You can even adjust the transparency and intensity of the overlay to reach the desired effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-5.jpg"                      alt="apply overlays to image"                ></p><h3 id="6-Straighten-the-Horizon"><a href="#6-Straighten-the-Horizon" class="headerlink" title="6. Straighten the Horizon"></a>6. Straighten the Horizon</h3><p>Want to create a balanced and stable look for your image? You can easily achieve that by straightening the lines in your image. Although a simple trick, it is often overlooked and can impact the overall symmetry of your image.</p><p>You can choose a baseline in your image and then adjust it to straighten the image. Setting the skew during post-processing can help you create impactful images. Usually, the horizon is used as the baseline that needs straightening. You can also choose any other line in your photo and make use of the grid to rotate your image until it is in order.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-6.jpg"                      alt="straighten the horizon"                ></p><h3 id="7-Split-the-Tone"><a href="#7-Split-the-Tone" class="headerlink" title="7. Split the Tone"></a>7. Split the Tone</h3><p>During the photography editing process, a little split-tone can go a long way. This means you can add specific colors to the shadows and highlights of your image. You can play with these colors to make your photos fall on the warm or cold end of the spectrum. Split tone can get out of hand pretty fast, so remember to keep it subtle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-7.jpg"                      alt="use split tone feature"                ></p><h3 id="8-Know-your-White-Balance"><a href="#8-Know-your-White-Balance" class="headerlink" title="8. Know your White Balance"></a>8. Know your White Balance</h3><p>Adjusting your image’s white balance is crucial for the photography editing process. All the light sources around you have their specific temperatures. They can thus bring a specific color temperature to the photo. Cameras are usually set at auto white balance, but you can alter that in the post-processing to satisfy your requirements.</p><p>While JPEG images can somewhat bend to a specific color temperature, RAW files offer a greater degree of flexibility. You can adjust your white balance to bring the photo towards a warmer or cooler tone. You can also create a warm&#x2F;cold contrast to bring a dramatic effect to your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-8.jpg"                      alt="adjust image white balance"                ></p><h3 id="9-Pay-Attention-to-Details"><a href="#9-Pay-Attention-to-Details" class="headerlink" title="9. Pay Attention to Details"></a>9. Pay Attention to Details</h3><p>Being a photographer means having to keep a close eye on the details. No matter what type of photographs you are capturing, everything from nature to headshots requires keen attention to detail. One way of doing so is to remove spots or any background clutter from your picture.</p><p>Most of the prime photography editing apps offer spot removal tools. You will often encounter images where some careful adjustments are inherent. You can remove blemishes, stains, or any other distracting element from your image. This will help bring a clean and focused look to your picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-9.jpg"                      alt="remove the spots from image"                ></p><h3 id="10-Don’t-Take-It-Too-Far"><a href="#10-Don’t-Take-It-Too-Far" class="headerlink" title="10. Don’t Take It Too Far"></a>10. Don’t Take It Too Far</h3><p>It is quite easy to get carried away during photography editing. Remember not to take your editing a step too far. Try to keep the natural element of the image intact and avoid overdoing the contrast and color saturation. Heavy editing can often cause a perfectly good image to fall apart. Steer clear of unnatural editing and strong color grading.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-10.jpg"                      alt="do natural image editing"                ></p><h2 id="Wrapping-Up"><a href="#Wrapping-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h2><p>The process of image editing is not always a piece of cake.

In this case, you must create a channel name that is true to your content and catchy so it hooks the audience from the start.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot-1"><a href="#Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4.

You should also be able to recognize your podcast name if you hear it in passing, and it should be easy to pronounce.

Can 2 podcasts have the same name?"></a>1. Can 2 podcasts have the same name?</h3><p>The simple answer would be <strong>“No.”</strong> You cannot have a podcast whose name is similar to another. It becomes an issue of legality and ethicality. If you create a channel with a name similar to another podcast, the original podcast channel will have a right to sue your channel.</p><p>In some rare cases, there have been podcasts with similar names, but usually, one of them will eventually go down.

Should I name my podcast my name?</h3><p>There’s nothing wrong with naming your podcast with your name as long as it is unique and stands out. You cannot simply name your podcast, i.e., “<strong>Joe Rogan</strong>.” Instead, your podcast can include your name creatively, such as, i.e., <strong>“The Joe Rogan Experience.”</strong></p><h3 id="3-Can-someone-steal-my-podcast-name-1"><a href="#3-Can-someone-steal-my-podcast-name-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

Unfortunately, it is common in the industry as people tend to prey on the weak ones. But you can protect your channel by creating a podcast name that is unique in itself.</p><p>If you find accounts that pretend to be your channel, you can ask your audience to report such sources. Or the best course is legal action. But first, develop a trademark policy to help you give immunity against these channels.</p><p>So if in the future it gets to mislead your audience, they will be held accountable for legal action.</p><h3 id="4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast-1"><a href="#4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

But as your audience grows, changing the channel’s name will only disturb your audience. They might think the original content creator was changed or the purpose of the show has been changed.</p><p>Keeping to your originality and creativity will set your channel in the light. Your goal should be to choose a Podcast name that is unique from the beginning and work on growing it to its</p><p>best potential.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/in-2024-comparative-analysis-of-best-win-driven-art-tools/"><u>In 2024, Comparative Analysis of Best Win-Driven Art Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/leading-tools-seamless-youtube-to-twitter-transfers/"><u>Leading Tools  Seamless YouTube-to-Twitter Transfers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/mastering-light-manipulation-for-captivating-gopro-time-lapse-scenes/"><u>Mastering Light Manipulation for Captivating GoPro Time Lapse Scenes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/how-to-start-and-sustain-an-indie-podcast-hit/"><u>How to Start & Sustain an Indie Podcast Hit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-changing-your-windows-11-backdrop-with-precision/"><u>2024 Approved  Changing Your Windows 11 Backdrop with Precision</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/stylish-shutter-discover-the-top-10-free-lapithexcellence-pics/"><u>Stylish Shutter  Discover the Top 10 Free Lapithexcellence Pics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/in-2024-capturing-magic-in-microphones-iphoneipad-tactics-for-superior-recordings/"><u>In 2024, Capturing Magic in Microphones  IPhone/iPad Tactics for Superior Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/premier-visual-quality-leaks/"><u>Premier Visual Quality Leaks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-deleting-tiktok-watermarks-online-for-2024/"><u>Updated The Ultimate Guide to Deleting TikTok Watermarks Online for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-8-safe-and-effective-methods-to-unlock-your-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-without-a-passcode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, 8 Safe and Effective Methods to Unlock Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Without a Passcode | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-upgrade-iphone-12-without-losing-anything-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Upgrade iPhone 12 without Losing Anything? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-planning-to-use-a-pokemon-go-joystick-on-apple-iphone-12-mini-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Planning to Use a Pokemon Go Joystick on Apple iPhone 12 mini? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/streamline-your-browsing-with-these-7-android-centric-adblockers-for-2024/"><u>Streamline Your Browsing with These 7 Android-Centric AdBlockers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/possible-solutions-to-restore-deleted-call-logs-from-oppo-a38-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/"><u>Possible solutions to restore deleted call logs from Oppo A38</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-level-up-your-video-editing-skills-6-must-know-adobe-premiere-secrets/"><u>New 2024 Approved Level Up Your Video Editing Skills 6 Must-Know Adobe Premiere Secrets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-engage-inspire-convert-strategizing-for-impactful-instavideo-content/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Engage, Inspire, Convert  Strategizing for Impactful InstaVideo Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-power-of-irecorder-in-action/"><u>2024 Approved  The Power of iRecorder in Action</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

In layman terms, audio crossfades duration refers to the amount of time a Media Player needs to fade out one music before fading in the next. In the Crossfade editor, you may change the default crossfades length and form. If you’re looking to kickstart your audio editing journey with the audio cross fade as a part of it? Refer to the upcoming sections to learn that hassle-free.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">What is Fade</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">What is Crossfade</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Crossfade Audio</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Crossfade audio on Smartphone</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-1">Crossfade Audio on Computer</a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-1-Audio-Fade-Vs-Crossfade"><a href="#Part-1-Audio-Fade-Vs-Crossfade" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Audio Fade Vs Crossfade"></a>Part 1. Audio Fade Vs Crossfade</h2><h3 id="What-is-Fade"><a href="#What-is-Fade" class="headerlink" title="What is Fade?"></a>What is Fade?</h3><p>You may use fades to gently raise or lower the level at the beginning or conclusion of audio events or audio clips and to make transitions seem seamless. You may gradually raise or lower the level of audio events or audio clips by using fade ins and fade outs. Event-based or clip-based fade ins and fade outs are also possible. In this situation, the fade feature in a sequencer or audio editor may often be utilized swiftly and efficiently.</p><p>A video transition is comparable to an audio fade. There is often a sweet spot when the fading truly disappears. You often have a choice of fade curves with fade functions. Using the faders on a mixer, whether it be hardware or software, is the most natural method to fade. All current software sequencers will capture your motions, allowing you to modify, fade, and tune until you find the perfect rhythm. Keep fade-ins brief in most situations unless you’re going for a specific impact.</p><h3 id="What-is-Crossfade"><a href="#What-is-Crossfade" class="headerlink" title="What is Crossfade?"></a>What is Crossfade?</h3><p>Adding an audio transition between two adjacent audio clips on the same track creates a crossfade. You may apply a crossfade transition to either end of a single clip to have it fade in or fade out. A crossfade is the technique of fading one piece of audio out while also fading the other one in, unlike a fade, which is conducted on only one piece of audio. The sound engine’s maximum crossfade time when switching from Sound A to Sound B is equal to half the duration of Audio File A.</p><p>You may use crossfades to provide seamless transitions between several audio events on the same track. Crossfading is always depending on events. You may manually carry out a crossfade, just as with fades. The two songs’ blended versions must be routed to two distinct sets of faders. Only when the subsequent events or their corresponding clips overlap can crossfades be made. This is typically used in recording to make one track on an album fade into or blend with the next. When done well, it has a fantastic impact.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Crossfade Audio"></a>Part 2. How to Crossfade Audio</h2><p>Because a crossfade requires a bit more work than a fade, it’s important to consider the assistance your sequencer or audio editor may provide. Most include a crossfade feature, and some, once more, give users a choice of curvature. Additionally, you may be able to utilize one fade-in curve and a second one for the fade-out.</p><h3 id="1-Crossfade-audio-on-Smartphone"><a href="#1-Crossfade-audio-on-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="1. Crossfade audio on Smartphone"></a>1. Crossfade audio on Smartphone</h3><p>The crossfade function in Spotify for Android and iOS ensures that your music never stops playing by removing the pause between songs. A crossfade is a musical effect in which the sound of one track begins to fade out and the sound of the following song begins to fade in.</p><p>Due to the prevalence of transitions in album tracks, Spotify by default does not provide Crossfade.</p><p><strong>Step to crossfade audio with Spotify:</strong></p><p>Step1 Open the Spotify app on your Android smartphone first. As shown in the picture below, you must now press on the Settings gear icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/press-settings-spotify-app.jpg"                      alt="press settings spotify app"                ></p><p>Step2 The Playback section may be found on the Settings page. Scroll down to the “Crossfade” section on iOS. Toggle the option to the “On” position by tapping it. To choose the crossfade length on Android, tap and move the slider. Alternatively, drag the slider all the way to the left to turn off the crossfade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crossfade-audio-spotify-app.jpg"                      alt="crossfade audio spotify app"                ></p><p>Step3 You may crossfade tracks on Spotify using this method. The app’s built-in audio normalization tool, which can quickly balance mild and loud music for a more even sound experience, is available to Spotify Premium customers. Obviously, you won’t get much in the way of beat matching, but at least the song will continue playing continuously.</p><h3 id="2-Crossfade-Audio-on-Computer"><a href="#2-Crossfade-Audio-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="2.

But you didn’t have time to go through it, and you bookmarked it. Now, you came back to read it and, oh no…… It has been deleted for some reason.</p><p>No need to worry. You can see deleted Reddit posts in seconds. In fact, there are several simple methods to do this.</p><p>We’ll cover the best ones below and explain how to use each one.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Unddit</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Reveddit</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Resavr</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">The Wayback Machine</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Google Cache</a></li></ol><h2 id="5-Ways-to-See-Deleted-Reddit-Posts"><a href="#5-Ways-to-See-Deleted-Reddit-Posts" class="headerlink" title="5 Ways to See Deleted Reddit Posts"></a>5 Ways to See Deleted Reddit Posts</h2><h3 id="1-Unddit"><a href="#1-Unddit" class="headerlink" title="1. Unddit"></a>1. Unddit</h3><p>Unddit is a third-party tool that uses Pushshift.io. This is a database that stores comments users leave on Reddit.</p><p>The main reason Unddit is so popular and used is because of its simplicity. It is easy to use the tool and takes about 10 seconds to set it all up. Let’s go over the steps to use Unddit and reveal some deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>Step1 First, go to <a class="link"   href="https://www.unddit.com/" >Unddit.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step2 Click on the red “Unddit” button and drag it to your bookmark bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/red-unddit-button.png"                      alt="unddit button pointing to bookmark"                ></p><p>Step3 Go to the deleted Reddit post</p><p>Step4 Click on the Unddit bookmark you just saved</p><p>This will automatically lead you to a new page. There, Unddit analyses and displays all the deleted comments from that post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/unddit-results.png"                      alt="results page on unddit tool"                ></p><p>On the downside, Reddit doesn’t work well with most Reddit posts. It’s more effective for revealing deleted comments. Additionally, it may show an error from time to time. Unfortunately, the reason isn’t always displayed, and it’s something we need to live with.</p><h3 id="2-Reveddit"><a href="#2-Reveddit" class="headerlink" title="2. Reveddit"></a>2. Reveddit</h3><p>Unlike Unddit, Reveddit will always help you find deleted Reddit posts. It’s a powerful tool and much more stable compared to so many others out there.</p><p>This tool tracks Reddit activity in real-time. For example, you can use it to track deleted posts from specific users and subreddits. You can also insert a direct link into its search bar and head straight to the deleted post.</p><p>To use Reveddit, you should follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Go to Reveddit.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a specific username, subreddit name, or simply insert the link of the deleted post</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-search.png"                      alt="search bar on reveddit tool"                ></p><p>Step3 Click “Go” and it will display every deleted Reddit post within that search query</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-results.png"                      alt="reveddit results page"                ></p><p>There’s one thing you need to remember about Reveddit. While it quickly shows deleted posts on Reddit, this only applies to posts and comments that were deleted by moderators or bots. So, if a user deleted their post, Reveddit won’t display that one in the results.</p><h3 id="3-Resavr"><a href="#3-Resavr" class="headerlink" title="3. Resavr"></a>3. Resavr</h3><p>Resavr is another simple tool that instantly displays deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>It’s pretty similar to the other tools, except it only reveals comments, not Reddit posts. However, Resavr can display comments much longer than 650 words, while some tools can’t do this.</p><p>Here’s how to use this simple tool. It only takes a few seconds:</p><p>Step1 Go to Resavr.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a keyword in the top-right corner search bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/resavr-search-bar.png"                      alt="resavr home page"                ></p><p>Step3 It will display a list of Google results with Reddit posts that have deleted comments</p><p>The main disadvantage of Resavr is its search feature. There’s no way to search for a specific Reddit post. Instead, you can only view recent posts with deleted comments. Or you can type in a specific word and go through all the posts that pop up to find what you’re looking for.</p><h3 id="4-The-Wayback-Machine"><a href="#4-The-Wayback-Machine" class="headerlink" title="4. The Wayback Machine"></a>4. The Wayback Machine</h3><p>The Wayback Machine is a powerful tool that stores archives of other websites’ caches. It’s a non-profit site that lets you see deleted Reddit posts and comments that have been stored in the past.</p><p>It’s a bit more complicated to use, but it offers fantastic results. So, here’s what you need to do:</p><p>Step1 Visit archive.org. (Wayback Machine’s official website)</p><p>Step2 Paste the link to the deleted post and hit “Enter”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-bar.png"                      alt="wayback machine search bar"                ></p><p>Step3 Wayback Machine will display the results in a calendar format. Click on a date to see all deleted posts on that day in history.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-results.png"                      alt="result page on wayback machine website"                ></p><p>Wayback Machine is a little slower when loading the results than other tools. But it gives you a comprehensive list of all the deleted content highlighted when it loads.</p><p>There is another downside. This tool doesn’t archive everything instantly. So, there is a chance that some posts won’t pop up if a Reddit moderator deleted the post before Wayback Machine could archive it.</p><h3 id="5-Google-Cache"><a href="#5-Google-Cache" class="headerlink" title="5. Google Cache"></a>5. Google Cache</h3><p>Last but not least, it’s the Google Cache method. This isn’t so much a tool as it is a way to reveal deleted Reddit posts. It won’t go as far back in time as Wayback Machine to display deleted Reddit posts. It only shows recently deleted ones.</p><p>On the bright side, this method is straightforward to use. All you need to do is:</p><p>Step1 Search for the deleted Reddit post on Google</p><p>Step2 When you find the result, click on the three dots next to the page’s link</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cache-method.png"                      alt="google search result three dots"                ></p><p>Step3 Then, select “Cached” from the small new window that pops up</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cached-button.png"                      alt="google search result cached feature"                ></p><p>This takes you to a previous version of the page when Google bots last visited it. Hopefully, this was when the post wasn’t yet deleted. You can’t know until you see the page and check it out.</p><p>Google Cache can be either a huge win or a total failure. It depends on the post itself. If it works, it will show you everything. However, if you’re too late to the party, you won’t be able to see anything from the deleted post.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Being able to see deleted posts on Reddit can be tricky. Reddit doesn’t allow this, but it often gets overlooked, thanks to some of the tools we’ve discussed here. Even though it’s not permitted, sometimes we all want to read a post we saved a while ago.</p><p>Just remember, these tools can often stop working. This is because they don’t meet Reddit’s guidelines and run without the company’s permission. It’s not illegal or anything, but it just may crash and not display your desired results. Use them while you can and find deleted Reddit posts you want to check out.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>5 Ways to See Deleted Reddit Posts</p><h3 id="1-Unddit-1"><a href="#1-Unddit-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can also insert a direct link into its search bar and head straight to the deleted post.</p><p>To use Reveddit, you should follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Go to Reveddit.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a specific username, subreddit name, or simply insert the link of the deleted post</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-search.png"                      alt="search bar on reveddit tool"                ></p><p>Step3 Click “Go” and it will display every deleted Reddit post within that search query</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-results.png"                      alt="reveddit results page"                ></p><p>There’s one thing you need to remember about Reveddit. While it quickly shows deleted posts on Reddit, this only applies to posts and comments that were deleted by moderators or bots. So, if a user deleted their post, Reveddit won’t display that one in the results.</p><h3 id="3-Resavr-1"><a href="#3-Resavr-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Resavr"></a>3. Resavr</h3><p>Resavr is another simple tool that instantly displays deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>It’s pretty similar to the other tools, except it only reveals comments, not Reddit posts. However, Resavr can display comments much longer than 650 words, while some tools can’t do this.</p><p>Here’s how to use this simple tool. It only takes a few seconds:</p><p>Step1 Go to Resavr.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a keyword in the top-right corner search bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/resavr-search-bar.png"                      alt="resavr home page"                ></p><p>Step3 It will display a list of Google results with Reddit posts that have deleted comments</p><p>The main disadvantage of Resavr is its search feature. There’s no way to search for a specific Reddit post. Instead, you can only view recent posts with deleted comments. Or you can type in a specific word and go through all the posts that pop up to find what you’re looking for.</p><h3 id="4-The-Wayback-Machine-1"><a href="#4-The-Wayback-Machine-1" class="headerlink" title="4. The Wayback Machine"></a>4. The Wayback Machine</h3><p>The Wayback Machine is a powerful tool that stores archives of other websites’ caches. It’s a non-profit site that lets you see deleted Reddit posts and comments that have been stored in the past.</p><p>It’s a bit more complicated to use, but it offers fantastic results. So, here’s what you need to do:</p><p>Step1 Visit archive.org. (Wayback Machine’s official website)</p><p>Step2 Paste the link to the deleted post and hit “Enter”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-bar.png"                      alt="wayback machine search bar"                ></p><p>Step3 Wayback Machine will display the results in a calendar format. Click on a date to see all deleted posts on that day in history.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-results.png"                      alt="result page on wayback machine website"                ></p><p>Wayback Machine is a little slower when loading the results than other tools. But it gives you a comprehensive list of all the deleted content highlighted when it loads.</p><p>There is another downside. This tool doesn’t archive everything instantly. So, there is a chance that some posts won’t pop up if a Reddit moderator deleted the post before Wayback Machine could archive it.</p><h3 id="5-Google-Cache-1"><a href="#5-Google-Cache-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Google Cache"></a>5. Google Cache</h3><p>Last but not least, it’s the Google Cache method. This isn’t so much a tool as it is a way to reveal deleted Reddit posts. It won’t go as far back in time as Wayback Machine to display deleted Reddit posts. It only shows recently deleted ones.</p><p>On the bright side, this method is straightforward to use. All you need to do is:</p><p>Step1 Search for the deleted Reddit post on Google</p><p>Step2 When you find the result, click on the three dots next to the page’s link</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cache-method.png"                      alt="google search result three dots"                ></p><p>Step3 Then, select “Cached” from the small new window that pops up</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cached-button.png"                      alt="google search result cached feature"                ></p><p>This takes you to a previous version of the page when Google bots last visited it. Hopefully, this was when the post wasn’t yet deleted. You can’t know until you see the page and check it out.</p><p>Google Cache can be either a huge win or a total failure. It depends on the post itself. If it works, it will show you everything. However, if you’re too late to the party, you won’t be able to see anything from the deleted post.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Being able to see deleted posts on Reddit can be tricky. Reddit doesn’t allow this, but it often gets overlooked, thanks to some of the tools we’ve discussed here. Even though it’s not permitted, sometimes we all want to read a post we saved a while ago.</p><p>Just remember, these tools can often stop working. This is because they don’t meet Reddit’s guidelines and run without the company’s permission. It’s not illegal or anything, but it just may crash and not display your desired results. Use them while you can and find deleted Reddit posts you want to check out.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-androids-fastest-vid-tuning-tools-reviewed/"><u>[Updated] Android's Fastest Vid Tuning Tools Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/uncovering-the-mysteries-of-photo-editing-in-canva/"><u>Uncovering the Mysteries of Photo Editing in Canva</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/identifying-key-windows-movie-maker-alternatives/"><u>Identifying Key Windows Movie Maker Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-command-line-and-gui-mastering-windowsmacos-srt-file-handling/"><u>[New] Command Line & GUI  Mastering Windows/MacOS SRT File Handling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-choose-right-gopro-hero5-vs-garmin-virb-updated-22/"><u>2024 Approved  Choose Right  GoPro Hero5 Vs.

Although iPhone X is one of the best gadgets in the recent times, it can be pretty complex too. In spite of using the device now, you may not know the hidden <strong>iPhone X tips and tricks</strong>, which Apple keeps adding with each software upgrade. In order to make your daily usage of iPhone X device simple and easy, here are the 10 iPhone X tips and tricks. Run the latest iOS version and get going with these missing features.</p><h2 id="10-Hidden-iPhone-X-Tips-and-Tricks"><a href="#10-Hidden-iPhone-X-Tips-and-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="10 Hidden iPhone X Tips and Tricks"></a>10 Hidden iPhone X Tips and Tricks</h2><h4 id="1-Take-a-Screenshot-using-iPhone-X-tips-and-tricks"><a href="#1-Take-a-Screenshot-using-iPhone-X-tips-and-tricks" class="headerlink" title="1. Take a Screenshot using iPhone X tips and tricks"></a>1. Take a Screenshot using iPhone X tips and tricks</h4><p>Are you used to taking screenshots pressing the side button and the home button? What will you do with your iPhone X? It has no home button. Forget all your worries as the iPhone X tips and tricks help in easing your worries instantly. To take a screenshot on your iPhone X, press the side button and the volume up button simultaneously. The rest of the working is exactly as you see in other iPhones.</p><h4 id="2-Hard-Reset"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset"></a>2. Hard Reset</h4><p>What, if your iPhone X becomes unresponsive? iPhone X tips and tricks help you to force hard reset the iPhone X by swiftly pressing the volume up button first, then pressing the volume down button, and finally pressing and holding the side button. Apart from holding the side button, do not hold any of the volume buttons. You can observe the Apple logo when you hold the side button for 10-15 seconds and leave it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iPhone-X-Hard-Reset-Buttons-min.png"                      alt="hard reset"                ></p><h4 id="3-Battery-Percentage"><a href="#3-Battery-Percentage" class="headerlink" title="3. Battery Percentage"></a>3. Battery Percentage</h4><p>The iOS doesn’t feature a default battery percentage display. But, the settings can be used to turn on the display for battery percentage. The iPhone X is different, the setting has been removed from this device but don’t you worry. Just from the right side of the notch, swipe down and the option is integrated into the control center.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iOS_battery_percentage.jpg"                      alt="battery percentage"                ></p><h4 id="4-Virtual-Home-Button"><a href="#4-Virtual-Home-Button" class="headerlink" title="4. Virtual Home Button"></a>4. Virtual Home Button</h4><p>Are you missing the home button feature on your iPhone X device? Unfortunately, it is not really possible to bring it back physically but replicating the home button is definitely possible with the use of the software. So, what is the procedure to get a home button replica? Go to the general, click on the accessibility feature, then click on the assistive touch, and finally toggle it on. A virtual home button appears on the screen which you may modify to activate the shortcuts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-home-button.jpg"                      alt="home button"                ></p><h4 id="5-Optimize-Face-Id"><a href="#5-Optimize-Face-Id" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimize Face Id"></a>5. Optimize Face Id</h4><p>However fast the face ID is, at times, it cannot match up with the touch ID. But, the process of face ID can be accelerated with right habits and settings.</p><p>Firstly, click on the settings and then on the display and brightness feature to ensure “raise to wake” feature is enabled to stop you from having to tap on the screen. Swipe the phone upside so that your face is not seen directly on the screen and the face id gets time to authenticate and when you look to unlock your iPhone with the face ID, it directly takes you to the home screen. You may click on settings and then passcode and face ID to find the “require attention for face ID” feature to unlock the phone without looking directly on the screen. These iPhone X tips and tricks can greatly help to optimize the face ID.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/settings-face-id2.jpg"                      alt="face id"                ></p><h4 id="6-Quickly-Return-Home"><a href="#6-Quickly-Return-Home" class="headerlink" title="6. Quickly Return Home"></a>6. Quickly Return Home</h4><p>If there’s an opened app screen on your iPhone X, you may go back to the home screen by using the home indicator. And, if multiple app pages are opened on your device’s home screen, you may swipe from the bottom edge which takes you back to the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/home-indicator-iphone-x.jpg"                      alt="return home"                ></p><h4 id="7-Instantly-Open-the-Camera"><a href="#7-Instantly-Open-the-Camera" class="headerlink" title="7. Instantly Open the Camera"></a>7. Instantly Open the Camera</h4><p>Do you want to have the instant camera feature on your iPhone X? Just swipe from right to the left to disclose the camera. You may also 3D Touch the camera icon by pressing the lock screen icon for long. As you long press the lockscreen icon, the camera is revealed for you to take the snapshots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-x-open-camera.jpg"                      alt="open camera"                ></p><h4 id="8-Activate-Siri"><a href="#8-Activate-Siri" class="headerlink" title="8. Activate Siri"></a>8. Activate Siri</h4><p>In order to access Siri, press the side button for long without giving any voice command and activate Siri.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/siri.jpg"                      alt="siri"                ></p><h4 id="9-Use-Reachability-Again"><a href="#9-Use-Reachability-Again" class="headerlink" title="9. Use Reachability Again"></a>9. Use Reachability Again</h4><p>Do you miss the reachability feature where the display would slide down to reach the icons with one hand on the top of the screen by just a double touch on the home button? Why miss, when you can get it? Yes, the feature has not been removed from the iPhone X but it has just been hidden. Go to the general settings, click on the accessibility feature and scroll down to interaction to enable the reachability. For using the reachability feature, on the home bar bottom of the screen instantly swipe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Accessibility.png"                      alt="Accessibility"                ></p><h4 id="10-Flip-Between-Recent-Apps"><a href="#10-Flip-Between-Recent-Apps" class="headerlink" title="10. Flip Between Recent Apps"></a>10. Flip Between Recent Apps</h4><p>This is a familiar iPhone X functionality but you might have missed it while setting up your device. It is common for all of us to go through the tutorial quickly and then get to the phone. Isn’t it? But, if you have still missed it, then, from the home screen swipe right on the gesture bar. Now, you can quickly get into flipping between suspended apps. Furthermore, if you have flipped to an app that was not the last opened app, you can swipe both left and right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-x-multitasking.jpg"                      alt="Flip Between Recent Apps"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Keeping the iPhone X tips and tricks in mind, you get to access all the new and more handy iPhone X device. The iOS brings with it several new tips and tricks. These handy options work with the iPhone X.
