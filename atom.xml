It allows users to record everything in while keeping their hands free and the best part is that most of these are designed with outstanding qualities like water resistant, shockproof, freeze resistant and many more. Some of these can also be controlled via voice commands or remote applications hence they serve like best tool for athletes, professionals and beginner photographers. The wearable cameras can be clipped to almost all kind of surfaces; you can attach them to helmet, hat, harness, belt, T-shirt and even on your pets.</p><h2 id="What-to-look-for-while-buying-a-wearable-action-camera"><a href="#What-to-look-for-while-buying-a-wearable-action-camera" class="headerlink" title="What to look for while buying a wearable action camera"></a>What to look for while buying a wearable action camera</h2><p>Now you must be well aware of the fact that a wearable camera can help you enjoy your lifestyle in unique way and it can record everything for you on the go. But if you are new to camera world and are confused while making decision after watching so many competitive brands then it is good to make a list about what you must look for while buying an action camera. Below are few important features that your camera must have:</p><ol><li><strong>Photo and Video Quality:</strong> First of all you must compare the photo as well as video quality of your camera so that it can create high resolution end results and your videos can be YouTube ready right after recording.</li><li><strong>Camera weight, size and shape:</strong> Bullet shaped cameras are considered to be best if you want something to mount on your helmet whereas for chest mounting needs you must go ahead with box shaped cameras. A heavy camera unit will not fulfil your recording needs while biking or surfing so prefer to buy lightweight one with a small size.</li><li><strong>Streaming and Connectivity:</strong> It must be equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity options so that you can easily share, stream and view your collections on other devices. It also helps to operate your camera from remote locations via phone. Prefer to buy a camera that allows direct synchronization with websites for live streaming.</li><li><strong>Storage Capacity:</strong> Of course it must be higher, usually wearable action cameras can have microSD card capacity somewhere between 4GB to 120GB so you can make decision accordingly. Prefer to carry additional cards on your long tours.</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-sports?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-sports?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h2 id="Top-10-Best-Wearable-Action-Cameras-2017"><a href="#Top-10-Best-Wearable-Action-Cameras-2017" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Best Wearable Action Cameras 2017"></a>Top 10 Best Wearable Action Cameras 2017</h2><p>Most of adventure lovers prefer to carry a camera with them so that everything can be recorded during outdoor activities.

Based on your feasibility and the type of show, it can be detailed or include the essential things. However, the majority of podcast scripts adhere to the following basic format.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-write-podcast-script-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast script"                ></p><h3 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p>The intro is supposed to build the audience’s interest as soon as they start listening to the podcast.

In either case, the sponsor messaging should look natural and blend with the layout of your show. Besides, a persuasive sponsor message script will motivate listeners to buy brand products, thereby boosting your number of sponsors—a win-win situation.</p><h3 id="Segue"><a href="#Segue" class="headerlink" title="Segue"></a>Segue</h3><p>When there are multiple segments in an episode, transitions make switching from one to the next seamless. For example, it may be a piece of music, a phrase, motion graphics, etc.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>It’s challenging to retain everything after listening to a significant amount of information.

But don’t worry, as we are going to reveal some pro tips to nail your podcast script without much effort.</p><h3 id="How-do-I-write-my-first-podcast"><a href="#How-do-I-write-my-first-podcast" class="headerlink" title="How do I write my first podcast?"></a>How do I write my first podcast?</h3><p>Writing your first podcast script can be challenging, there’s no doubt about it, but if you keep the following ideas in mind while writing, you can produce a good one.</p><p><strong>(1) Avoid saying, ‘Subscribe or follow wherever you get your podcasts!</strong></p><p>The audience should be given a straightforward task, which we have stated many times previously. There is a high likelihood that people will ignore you if you ask them to “Subscribe or follow wherever you get your podcasts” or something similar.</p><p>Make sure to properly guide and simplify the task for the listeners if you want them to fulfill it. The links to other platforms where your podcast is available can be either attached in the notes section or included in the podcast itself.</p><p><strong>(2) Don’t overdo it with CTAs – it’s good to have a range, but stick to one or two per episode.</strong></p><p>Sometimes podcasters get overenthusiastic and stuff each episode with CTAs. That’s insane… Right? Respecting your audience’s time is just as crucial as getting views; failing to do so will result in losing them.</p><p>It’s good to have a range of CTAs, but stick to one or two per episode and try the rest in future episodes. It’s okay to repeat that one or two CTAs a couple of times during the episode to increase the probability that viewers will follow through.</p><p><strong>(3) Mention that it’s free to follow or subscribe</strong></p><p>Along with the CTA message, it’s a good idea to mention that following or subscribing is free. However, people may think they need to pay to subscribe because everything is shifting to a charged model from a free one.</p><p><strong>(4) Know the animating question of your podcast episode, and focus on answering it</strong></p><p>One of the most effective ways to keep the listeners interested throughout the episode is to communicate answers to their questions about that topic. The animating question is that a specific part of your episode answers an existing question. The key to finding the animating questions is “Research,” which will help you focus on the answers listeners want to hear.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436"                      border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Podcast-script-Hot-FAQs"><a href="#Podcast-script-Hot-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Podcast script Hot FAQs"></a>Podcast script Hot FAQs</h2><p>Sometimes the curiosity of people frightens me.

What makes a good podcast script?<p>The discourse on a podcast should feel human rather than robotic; thus, the script should provide some flexibility for improvisation. However, beginners often prefer a word-for-word script with all the information ready to deliver.</p><h3 id="3-Do-you-need-to-have-a-podcast-script"><a href="#3-Do-you-need-to-have-a-podcast-script" class="headerlink" title="3.

The resources utilized to express a story and convey a message include films, photography, animation, and music. These stories may distribute more widely and swiftly than ever through online platforms like webpages, journals, and social media sharing sites.</p><p><strong><em>“Simply put, it is telling stories with digital technologies. Digital stories are narratives built from the stuff of cyberculture.”</em></strong> <a class="link"   href="https://www.ala.org/acrl/publications/keeping%5Fup%5Fwith/storytelling#:~:text=It%20involves%20creating%20and%20sharing,telling%20stories%20with%20digital%20technologies." >-Bryan Alexander. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Additionally, digital storytelling can include a variety of digital narratives. A rising number of businesses are taking note and investigating the potential applications of a digital story. It is frequently employed to refer to filmmaking in general, and it has recently been used to describe commercial and non-profit advertising and promotion efforts.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Development-of-Digital-Storytelling"><a href="#Part-II-Development-of-Digital-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="Part II. Development of Digital Storytelling"></a>Part II. Development of Digital Storytelling</h2><p>Dana Atchley and Joe Lambert of the Center for Digital Storytelling started the digital storytelling advancement in 1994 by teaching others how to create digital stories. Although the power of storytelling has existed for thousands of years, it has only recently become possible for storytellers to <strong>“become digital”</strong> because of the advancement of personal computers and friendly modern communications.</p><p>High goals and outdated technologies coexisted throughout this period. Browsers were quite straightforward at the time, and dial-up remained still in use. There were no devices for accessing the internet, and most individuals read the digital narrative on their desktop computers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/tools-and-tips-virtual-storytelling-2.jpg"                      alt="tools and tips for virtual storytelling"                ></p><p>In this regard, the Center for Digital Storytelling developed a digital story that emphasized first-person narratives that framed memories as potent stories using visuals, audio, and music. The capacity to add graphics and narration to stories gives them a unique significance for both the author and the audience of virtual storytelling.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152810&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/842ca578342915ccb8ae069595ba7233/products/copy_bootit-ss1_178x139.jpg"                      border="0"                >The BootIt Collection covers multi-booting, partitioning, and disk imaging on traditional PC’s using the standard BIOS and  newer PC’s using UEFI.   The collection includes BootIt Bare Metal (BIBM) for standard BIOS systems and BootIt UEFI (BIU) for UEFI system.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Power-of-Digital-Storytelling-Compared-to-Traditional-Storytelling"><a href="#Power-of-Digital-Storytelling-Compared-to-Traditional-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="Power of Digital Storytelling Compared to Traditional Storytelling"></a>Power of Digital Storytelling Compared to Traditional Storytelling</h3><p>Compared to traditional storytelling, digital storytelling is far more integrative and incorporates non-linguistic factors that give rise to new narratives.

Practices of Digital Storytelling"></a>Part III. Practices of Digital Storytelling</h2><p>People are enticed to interact with stories and take measures as a result of seeing them because of the structure of digital storytelling and the ease with which they are shared.</p><p>Here are a few industries where digital storytelling is used:</p><p><strong>1. In Schools</strong></p><p>The ability to convey a digital story is essential in today’s schools since it allows teachers to better serve students from different language backgrounds.</p><p><strong>Uses In Education</strong></p><p>Digital storytelling creates online connections with students and provides feedback on their comprehension and progress. Students can learn crucial literacy skills like first-person viewpoint and narrative voice by telling personal experiences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/school-session-digital-narrative-4.jpg"                      alt="school session of digital narrative"                ></p><p>Further than language arts and media studies, digital storytelling is utilized to teach other curricular topics. To assist themselves and their audience in understanding better why a famous person behaved the way they did, students could, for instance, recount an incident from their lives.</p><p><strong>2. In Other Fields</strong></p><p>Through several chances for engagement, a strong digital story encourages viewer participation. Digital storytelling is used in a diverse range of situations and contexts.</p><p><strong>Uses in Marketing</strong></p><p>Utilizing cutting-edge contemporary tools and the potency of an effective marketing tale, youtube digital storytelling may connect with an intended audience on a whole new level. Examples of digital storytelling videos about your brand draw in and engage your target market.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/the-power-of-storytelling-marketing-world-5.jpg"                      alt="the power of storytelling in the marketing world"                ></p><p>Using specialized storylines, you may utilize brand storytelling to enhance your company’s appeal, humanize it, and highlight its core values. Virtual storytelling was once primarily used to describe filmmaking. It has developed to stand for marketing, promotion, and advertising by businesses and marketing teams.</p><p><strong>Uses in Social Networks</strong></p><p>The power of storytelling is the cornerstone of all effective social media networks. Accordingly, one of the fascinating methods for delivering messages and information is through a digital story. A digital narrative can help make your material more relatable, fascinating, and worthy of following on your chosen social network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/art-of-modern-storytelling-in-social-networks-6.jpg"                      alt="the art of modern storytelling in social networks"                ></p><p>Social networking platforms can also convey stories about your company, products, or anything else to engage your audience through digital storytelling.

Tip 6: Use Blend IF"></a>6. Tip 6: Use Blend IF</h3><p>If you want to change the color of leaves on a tree, you can use the “Blend IF” option of Adobe Photoshop to precisely do the changes. Start with duplicating the existing layer and then hiding the second layer. Double click on the layer to open the menu and then use “Blend IF” sliders. This option works when you drag the sliders to black points, and it automatically hides the dark pixels of your photo.</p><p>Similarly, if you drag the “Blend IF” sliders towards white pints, it can hide the light pixels. To hide any specific color from the picture, you can click on “Channels” and then select the color you want to eradicate completely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-9.jpg"                      alt="select the channel color"                ></p><p>This method only hides color based on their luminance values; however, this loads the entire layer when loading the active pixels. Regardless, this can be changed into transparency. For this, you need to select the layer by right-clicking and selecting the option of “Convert to Smart Object.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-10.jpg"                      alt="convert to smart object"                ></p><p>It helps the user create transparency across the layer. After hiding the layer and coming back to another object-specific layer, you can create a certain change in effect through adjustment layers. For instance, you can create a “Hue and Saturation” adjustment layer. With the above settings, Photoshop applies this as a layer mask for you. Use the sliders across the set layer to change the color across the selected areas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-11.jpg"                      alt="select your new color"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087407/7443" target="_top" id="2087407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087407"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="500"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Tip-7-Use-Online-Photo-Editor-to-Change-Colors"><a href="#7-Tip-7-Use-Online-Photo-Editor-to-Change-Colors" class="headerlink" title="7.

Personalize the Start Menu</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/a8.png"                      alt="a8"                ></p><p>The start menu of Windows 10 is now resizable. It can be quote odd for many but it is really surprising to know that with Windows 10, you can now customize the start menu and change its size to the extent you want. You now have the option to make it taller or wider as you like. If you wish to have the start menu taking up the whole left portion of the screen of your laptop or you want a thin strip transversely the taskbar, well that is now possible with Windows 10.

Using Cortana in Windows 10"></a>2. Using Cortana in Windows 10</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/update-win10-13.png"                      alt="update win10 13"                ></p><p>Cortana is finally here in Windows 10, taking control of the search functions as well as dishing out as much sass of the operating system in the same way with Windows Phone edition. On the other hand, by default, it will never listen and follow your commands.</p><p>If you would like to have the ability to simply bark commands at your personal computer, you launch Cortana through hitting the search field within the taskbar and then choose the Notebook icon in the left side choices pane. You choose “settings” from the list and have the “Let Cortana respond when you say ‘Hey Cortana’” choice. You will have an active and working microphone for it to work.</p><p>While you are poking around the Cortana’s options, you may dive in the Notebook menu so you can fine-tune exactly what data the digital assistant of Microsoft can open. On the other hand, you should bear in mind that like Google, the effectiveness of Cortana is related directly to how much it knows regarding you.</p><h4 id="3-Additional-Apps-you-should-try"><a href="#3-Additional-Apps-you-should-try" class="headerlink" title="3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Colors-Unleashed-Practical-Application-of-Color-Theory"><a href="#Colors-Unleashed-Practical-Application-of-Color-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Colors Unleashed: Practical Application of Color Theory"></a>Colors Unleashed: Practical Application of Color Theory</h2><p>So, you’ve heard about color theory but don’t know what it is or how to use it and you may also be wondering what color theory could possibly have to do with you. We are talking about the theory of all color combinations and how they can be altered or selected to better work together creating a more pleasant viewing for your audience.</p><p>If you are more selective with your colors in your videos or imagery the viewer will find this aesthetically pleasing and may be more engaged in your content. This includes anything from logo design all the way to props for your shot. When creating your videos within Filmora it is good practice to think about your composition in all aspects including color theory and with the guide hopefully you will have a better understanding of how you can influence your color palette.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Color-Theory"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Theory" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Theory"></a>What Is Color Theory</h2><p>Color theory consists of many elements that could fill a library on its own but for this guide we will focus on two key elements. The color wheel and color harmony. By understanding the color wheel and color harmony you can hand pick which colors to add or use in your pieces to create a well-balanced viewing experience which can help in viewer engagement and enjoyment.</p><p>There are many color wheels out there and all require understanding and research into that particular color arrangement but for this guide I will be focusing on the more widely used RGB which derives from the primary colors red green and blue, If you’re thinking why red green and blue not red yellow and blue then you are observant, while RYB is taught as the three primary colors we will be using what is known as additive primary colors of light meaning the more you add of these colors the closer to white you get, the reason we will be using this combination is due to the fact RYB misses a lot of hues around the violet area and the blue-greens meaning we achieve a higher range of color to pick from. With this in mind let’s start.</p><h2 id="The-Color-Wheel"><a href="#The-Color-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="The Color Wheel"></a>The Color Wheel</h2><p>Using red, green and blue as primary colors we can mix the colors to one another to get our secondary colors giving us yellow, magenta and cyan. We can mix these to one another to create our tertiary colors which are raspberry, orange, sprig green, turquoise, ocean and violet giving us something which looks like this</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/color-wheel.jpg"                      alt="colcor wheel"                ></p><p>As you can see, we have every color available in this wheel and they are arranged in a unison with the mixed colors starting with red, green and blue and working towards each other.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872456/14483" target="_top" id="1872456"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872456"                      border="0" alt="" width="500" height="375"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872456/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Color-Harmony"><a href="#Color-Harmony" class="headerlink" title="Color Harmony"></a>Color Harmony</h2><p>So now we know how the wheel is made and what it looks like. What does it do? We can use this wheel now to gather our palette. Within color theory we talk about harmonious colors that work together in a pleasant way creating less stress on the eyes to find information in your scene.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-harmony.jpg"                      alt="color harmony"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-office-pdf-editor-1x.890dbda.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>One such harmony is complementary colors and luckily for us this is very easy to find. You take your base color and find the opposite color on the wheel. In this example the complementary color to blue is yellow depicted with a red line.</p><p>These colors always work as they create contrast and stability.</p><p>The blue lines represent what is known as split contrasting colors and these will create balance with each other.</p><p>The corners of the black rectangle land on what is known as tetradic complement and allows you to add four colors with the understanding that they will complement each other perfectly. Lastly is the purple line which represents the analogous complementary colors, you can pick these neighboring colors with the peace of mind that they will harmonize with each other. There are many more but these four are the main ones that you will use more often than any other, by selecting colors using these four main types you can create a palette for your scenes and allow the viewer to effortlessly enjoy your content. These types work no matter where you start from on the wheel so long as you keep the distances the same.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="But-How-Do-I-Use-This"><a href="#But-How-Do-I-Use-This" class="headerlink" title="But How Do I Use This"></a>But How Do I Use This</h2><p>You may still be unsure as to how to implement color theory into your videos. Let’s look at some scenarios that color theory may help your creations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-color-theory-video.jpg"                      alt="apply color theory video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>In this scene the director decided that the backdrop should complement the top the actor is wearing, looking at our wheel we can see the complementary color would be dark purple so they started with that, to create a more dynamic scene they then used the analogous colors of that purple being pink and red and created the backdrop. This creates a harmony within the scene and makes it effortless to see all the key elements straight away.</p><p>As you can see from this example the base color for the scene is a dark blue&#x2F;purple and using the analogous color of pink they created a point of interest within the scene that doesn’t look out of place. This is a very good way to pull the viewers eyes towards something you want them to take in above all else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/movie-cover-with-color-theory.jpg"                      alt="movie cover with color theory"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600113&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Win：Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>As you can see from all the movie covers above, they all use complementary colors from the blues to the war yellows and oranges, this creates high contrast and balance and is something done within the movie industry in every scene. It’s no coincidence that the joker is purple and green or that the iron man is red and gold, this is well prepared and researched in the planning stages of everything a visual artist creates.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B300x600%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-300x600.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>By including this into your thought process when creating videos with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will achieve well balanced and harmonious content for your viewer to enjoy and create better engagement.

The higher the brightness, the more luminous the picture will be. This means that bright and dark scenes will both be more easily identifiable.</p><p>In technical terms, the brightness of a video image is measured in nits. One nit is equal to one candela per square meter. If you have a television or monitor that is rated at 100 nits, it means it has a luminance of 100 Candelas per square meter (cd&#x2F;m2).</p><h4 id="What-should-my-video-brightness-be"><a href="#What-should-my-video-brightness-be" class="headerlink" title="What should my video brightness be?"></a>What should my video brightness be?</h4><p>The brightness of your videos should always be medium.

The higher the brightness, the more luminous the picture will be. This means that bright and dark scenes will both be more easily identifiable.</p><p>In technical terms, the brightness of a video image is measured in nits. One nit is equal to one candela per square meter. If you have a television or monitor that is rated at 100 nits, it means it has a luminance of 100 Candelas per square meter (cd&#x2F;m2).</p><h4 id="What-should-my-video-brightness-be-3"><a href="#What-should-my-video-brightness-be-3" class="headerlink" title="What should my video brightness be?"></a>What should my video brightness be?</h4><p>The brightness of your videos should always be medium.

For example, if you have a window in your video and it’s behind your subject, turn them around, so they’re facing the window.

They are actually set of specially designed airfoils that radiates from some strong central hub that bolts into motor or engine of device. When we talk about quadcopters then these propellers work like wings for the aircraft. Types of wings attached to your tiny aircraft are going to make huge difference in its actual flight. So, if you are thinking to buy a new set of propellers for your drone then it is important to go into some deep details before selection. Below are few important things that demand your attention.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Things to Consider when Choosing Drone Propellers</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Best Brand Recommendations</a></li></ul><h2 id="Things-to-Consider-when-Choosing-Drone-Propellers"><a href="#Things-to-Consider-when-Choosing-Drone-Propellers" class="headerlink" title="Things to Consider when Choosing Drone Propellers"></a>Things to Consider when Choosing Drone Propellers</h2><h4 id="1-Type"><a href="#1-Type" class="headerlink" title="1. Type"></a>1. Type</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Plastic</td><td>They are Light in weight</td><td>You will find balancing issue with this design</td></tr><tr><td>Affordable choice</td><td>They produce annoying sound and too much vibrations</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Carban fiber</td><td>They suffer lesser vibration and produce minimal sound</td><td>Too costly</td></tr><tr><td>Lightweight construction</td><td>They offer lower thrust as compared to plastic type designs</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Highly balanced design</td><td>Flight time is lesser</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>They offer high RPM with quick motor speed.</td><td>If they crash, motor bearing will naturally take most of the impact.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Highly resposnive</td><td>&#x2F;</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="2-Length-and-Pitch"><a href="#2-Length-and-Pitch" class="headerlink" title="2. Length and Pitch"></a>2. Length and Pitch</h4><p>Pitch can be defined as total distance travelled by your miniquad or drone with single rotation of propeller. For example, in case if we take 10x3.8 value then it means overall length is 10 whereas pitch is 3.8. Generally, propellers that offer lower pitches are able to produce more torque hence their motor naturally works with lesser current.</p><p>Those who are using high pitch type prop with have different results. In this case, more air gets displaced and it naturally caused more commotion. With this effect, drone will face more vibrations and you will observe more shakes while hovering. Hence, it is advised to buy propeller that offer lower pitch.</p><h4 id="3-Size"><a href="#3-Size" class="headerlink" title="3. Size"></a>3. Size</h4><p>If you have a drone propeller with small size then it is much easier to control overall speed of your device during flights. This facility is not available with larger propellers. The reason behind uncontrolled speed of larger prop type drones is that they need more time to shift from one speed level to another. But in other case, smaller drone prop are able to offer higher RPM for motors. With this higher RPM rating, blades are capable enough to spin fast and thus UAV can manage impressive flights.</p><p>Note that you must buy a motor that has lesser kV rating if you want to operate larger propellers. But in case if kV rating is high then it will suit to small sized props. Prefer to buy propellers with lower pitch values so that drones can stay stable in air.</p><h4 id="4-Number-of-Blades"><a href="#4-Number-of-Blades" class="headerlink" title="4. Number of Blades"></a>4. Number of Blades</h4><p>There is no doubt to say that you add more blades to your drone then its props will naturally have more thrust nut they actually become less efficient. The result is almost same as that of installing longer propeller. But if you have multiple blades then there is no need to install longer blades. Analysis says that tri blade type propellers are usually much better than that of two blade type props. Generally, tri blades type drone follow torque curve that ultimately makes yaw axis highly responsive.</p><h4 id="5-Price"><a href="#5-Price" class="headerlink" title="5. Price"></a>5. Price</h4><p>You can easily buy attractive multicolour type props; they are often available as pack of 4 or 2. While buying a new set, always make sure that your package contains equal number of clockwise and counter clockwise props. Generally, the plastic type props have price tag somewhere between $2 whereas for a set of 4, you have to pay $5. On the other side, the 3 plus bladed propellers use to be more expensive as compared to two blade versions.</p><h4 id="6-Conclusion"><a href="#6-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="6. Conclusion"></a>6. Conclusion</h4><p>After going through all these facts, we drive some important concluding points as:</p><ul><li>You can speed up a small sized prop with ease but larger ones take much time to shift from one speed level to another.</li><li>One need to install motor with higher RPM for smaller props as they are able to spin at faster pace and can naturally develop perfect lifting mechanism.</li><li>Lower kV type motors can easily deal with bigger props. If you require lesser vibration with higher stability then it is essential to move ahead with</li><li>Those who wish to perform acrobatics in air will demand motor connection with small props as it can offer fast turning motor design. Anything below 8 inches will suit your needs in this category.</li><li>In case if you want to organize flights with additional payload, like a video camera or gimbal etc then it is important to buy a larger prop with slower turning motor unit. Probably a 8 plus inch design will be best idea.</li></ul><h2 id="Best-Brand-Recommendations"><a href="#Best-Brand-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Best Brand Recommendations"></a>Best Brand Recommendations</h2><h4 id="1-Gemfan"><a href="#1-Gemfan" class="headerlink" title="1. Gemfan:"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="http://www.gemfanhobby.com/" >Gemfan: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Gemfan is well known as a classic manufacturer of props; you can buy a unique design for every UAV. You can order a tri blade design for better performance.</p><h4 id="2-HQProp"><a href="#2-HQProp" class="headerlink" title="2. HQProp:"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.hqprop.com/" >HQProp: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>HQProp is a potential competitor against Gemfan and they are popular enough in the multirotor market. One of the most popular propellers in this market is 5x4x3 Tri-blade prop, you can easily find it with most of devices. Props of HQprop company are usually of higher price and they are also very fragile.</p><h4 id="3-APC"><a href="#3-APC" class="headerlink" title="3. APC:"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.apcprop.com/" >APC: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Same as those DAL Props, APC’s 2 bladed props have unique reputation in market as they are rated to be indestructible designs. The specially designed tri blade offerings are highly durable and they stand out against all competitors in market.</p><h4 id="4-Luminier"><a href="#4-Luminier" class="headerlink" title="4. Luminier:"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="http://www.lumenier.com/products/propellers" >Luminier: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Recently, GetFPV launched its new quality prop model under Luminier Line. These props are well focused on racing needs and they are also rated high for few specific applications with each variable size range.</p><p>You can easily choose any of these big brands to fulfil your needs. Professionals generally recommend a tri blade design as it is powerful enough and can meet most of routine needs with ease. Never forget to consider overall payload at the time of prop selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ultimate-blueprints-livestream-and-log-sports-matches-effectively/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Ultimate Blueprints  Livestream & Log Sports Matches Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-archiving-your-favorites-the-complete-list-of-9-podcast-recording-steps/"><u>[New] Archiving Your Favorites  The Complete List of 9 Podcast Recording Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-audio-excellence-with-windows-11-a-beginner-written-by-your-name/"><u>[New] Audio Excellence with Windows 11  A Beginner' Written by [Your Name]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-augmented-realities-transforming-movie-production/"><u>[New] Augmented Realities  Transforming Movie Production</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-quick-steps-to-nostalgic-facebook-story-viewing/"><u>[New] In 2024, Quick Steps to Nostalgic Facebook Story Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-express-creativity-for-free-your-meme-toolbox-awaits/"><u>[Updated] Express Creativity for Free – Your Meme Toolbox Awaits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-navigating-through-best-liquid-physics-experiences-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Navigating Through Best Liquid Physics Experiences for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-vocal-clarity-macs-acoustic-secrets/"><u>[Updated] Vocal Clarity  Mac's Acoustic Secrets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-10-best-free-image-hosting-sites-never-lost-your-photos/"><u>2024 Approved  10 Best Free Image Hosting Sites [Never Lost Your Photos]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enhance-visuals-in-video-calls-with-ms-teams-zoom/"><u>2024 Approved  Enhance Visuals in Video Calls with MS Teams Zoom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/alternative-recreation-in-the-firstrow-rankings-for-2024/"><u>Alternative Recreation in the Firstrow Rankings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/av1-compression-a-beginners-overview-for-2024/"><u>AV1 Compression  A Beginner's Overview for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/bridging-gap-integrating-zoom-into-your-gmail-setup-for-2024/"><u>Bridging Gap  Integrating Zoom Into Your Gmail Setup for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/capturing-life-from-above-yuneec-breeze-experience-for-2024/"><u>Capturing Life From Above  Yuneec Breeze Experience for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/color-fidelity-unleashed-in-hps-dreamcolor-monitor/"><u>Color Fidelity Unleashed in HP's DreamColor Monitor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/constructing-premium-canon-chrono-images/"><u>Constructing Premium Canon Chrono Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/cookiebot-enabled-optimizing-your-website-with-leading-analytics-technology/"><u>Cookiebot-Enabled: Optimizing Your Website with Leading Analytics Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/elevate-your-photos-decoding-the-best-canva-tips/"><u>Elevate Your Photos  Decoding the Best Canva Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/engineering-a-memorable-trailer-narrative/"><u>Engineering a Memorable Trailer Narrative</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-nubia-z50s-pro-to-blackberry-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Nubia Z50S Pro to BlackBerry | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/identifying-high-impact-hdr-photography-tools/"><u>Identifying High-Impact HDR Photography Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/in-2024-crafting-content-that-captivates-easy-to-try-videos/"><u>In 2024, Crafting Content That Captivates  Easy-to-Try Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-planning-to-use-a-pokemon-go-joystick-on-sony-xperia-10-v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Planning to Use a Pokemon Go Joystick on Sony Xperia 10 V?

But within last few years many other companies have launched impressive models with all incredible features. One of such outstanding action camera is YI 4K Action Camera from Xiaomi. This camera is competing with GoPro devices in terms of design as well as features. And the best part is that you can buy this feature-rich camera with payment of $199.99 only. So let us discuss few interesting features of this new action cam that can help us to decide whether it is able to steal the crown from GoPro or not.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 15 Best Action Cameras &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Complete-Review-for-Yi-4k-Action-Camera"><a href="#Complete-Review-for-Yi-4k-Action-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Complete Review for Yi 4k Action Camera"></a>Complete Review for Yi 4k Action Camera</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FU9ZIMU/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01FU9ZIMU&linkId=8ffea9b2da130000b205cf9367ce3ccf" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="Design"><a href="#Design" class="headerlink" title="Design"></a>Design</h4><p> Let us start with the hardware part. Yi 4k looks almost same as that of GoPro device, even the waterproof case appears somewhat like GoPro product. Some resemblance is found in mobile applications as well as in mounting systems. The front side of Yi 4k is equipped with a lens and LED that provides current camera status indication. The 2.2 inch wide LCD screen is protected with Gorilla Glass whereas on top portion you will find holes for speaker and dual microphone. On the right side, a small flap is covering MicroUSB charging port and the left side is left bare.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yi-4k-product.jpg"                      alt="yi-4k-product"                ></p><h4 id="Specifications"><a href="#Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Specifications"></a>Specifications</h4><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Parameters</strong></th><th><strong>Details</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Processor</td><td>Ambarella A9SE chipset</td></tr><tr><td>Image sensor</td><td>Sony IMX377 1&#x2F;2.3” 12 megapixels CMOS sensor</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>3.4 ounces&#x2F;96g (battery+camera)</td></tr><tr><td>Video solution</td><td>4K 30&#x2F;25fps 2.5K 30&#x2F;25fps, 1440p 60&#x2F;50&#x2F;30&#x2F;25fps 1080p 120&#x2F;100&#x2F;60&#x2F;50&#x2F;30&#x2F;25fps 960p 120&#x2F;100&#x2F;60&#x2F;5ofps 720p 240&#x2F;240fps 480 240&#x2F;200fps</td></tr><tr><td>Photo features</td><td>Timer, burst at frequencies between 3p&#x2F;s and 30p&#x2F;6s</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>1430mAH assists up to 2hrs 35 mins with 1080p recording at 30fps</td></tr><tr><td>Waterproof</td><td>40m (with housing)</td></tr><tr><td>Connectivity</td><td>Bluetooth and dual-band Wi-Fi</td></tr><tr><td>Lens</td><td>155-degree wide-angle&#x2F; F2.8 aperture</td></tr><tr><td>Max photo resolution</td><td>12-megapixels</td></tr><tr><td>LCD display</td><td>2.19”touchscreen</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons"></a>Pros and Cons</h4><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Pros</strong></th><th><strong>Cons</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Impressive image quality</td><td>No mounts&#x2F;waterproof included</td></tr><tr><td>Ultimate battery life</td><td>You have to control everything with one button under water- that’s really difficult</td></tr><tr><td>Touch screen display is of very rich quality</td><td>It is little difficult to access MicroSD slot</td></tr><tr><td>Super-reliable advanced Wi-Fi connectivity</td><td>You will find it difficult to use LCD screen in direct Sunlight</td></tr><tr><td>Image stabilization feature can be activated at 1080p</td><td>Additional protective housing is must for underwater usage</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Accessories"><a href="#Accessories" class="headerlink" title="Accessories"></a>Accessories</h4><p> You will find a USB charging cable with your camera- nothing else. You need to buy you own power adapter. This is really sad when we compare it with GoPro Hero4 Black where box include waterproof case and mounting clips. You will have to pay $40 to get official Yi waterproof case and the best part is that it is compatible with GoPro device.</p><p> Want to know more about the best accessories for Xiaomi Yi 4K action camera?

Battery life as well as settings and controls, everything is much easier. In order to capture slow motion videos you can go to 720p with 240fps. Further, the time lapse mode leads to impressive addition and you will definitely enjoy electronic image stabilization with fish eye reduction feature.</p><ul><li><strong>Image Quality:</strong></li></ul><p> The image capturing ability of Yi 4K is really impressive but it is not up to Hero4 Black level in terms of colour and deep details.

Few users have rated the effect of image stabilization feature very low as compared to GoPro devices but it is fine for beginners.</p><ul><li><strong>Auto Low Light:</strong></li></ul><p> If you prefer to record videos in low light location then your camera will automatically move to low light mode. The shutter speed can be adjusted as per need to boost the recording performance in night hours.

The video is created by taking photos at regular intervals and then editing them together so that they appear to run in real-time. One of the most popular uses of GoPro time-lapse videos is when you want to capture something in motion.</p><p>You can use this technique for many different types of subjects including landscapes, cars, people, and animals and you can even add sounds like birds chirping or waves crashing along with them! It’s also possible to make this type of video if you’re using any other camera brand than GoPro itself. This method produces high-quality videos that can be used as promotional material.</p><p>The GoPro time-lapse creates the final video by stitching together the individual still images into one long clip. The software also allows you to manipulate each frame individually, which can be used to adjust the focus and exposure settings of your shot. GoPro Time-lapse videos are videos that show a sequence of events over a substantial period.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/gopro-timelapse-video-mode.jpg"                      alt="gopro timelapse video mode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-GoPro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-GoPro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with GoPro"></a>Part 2: How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with GoPro</h2><p>If you’re a videographer or photographer, you’ve probably considered shooting time-lapse videos. They’re great for showing the passage of time, but they can also be used to show the beauty of a place. With GoPro cameras, you can create a time-lapse video in just minutes. Here’s how to shoot your time-lapse video with GoPro.</p><h5 id="Step1-Choose-your-shooting-mode"><a href="#Step1-Choose-your-shooting-mode" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Choose your shooting mode"></a>Step1 Choose your shooting mode</h5><p>Firstly, choose the shooting mode, that is which kind of mode you want. If you want to shoot a time-lapse video then first click on the mode button and select the video mode. The video mode will be shown on the front screen after pressing it.</p><h5 id="Step2-Select-the-time-lapse-mode"><a href="#Step2-Select-the-time-lapse-mode" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Select the time-lapse mode"></a>Step2 Select the time-lapse mode</h5><p>Press the set-up button and go to the video settings which are held on the left side. After that click on the time-lapse video. There are many features and options in HERO8. There is a night lapse option in GoPro which is normally used in night photography.

The time-lapse mode was used in earlier models.</p><h5 id="Step3-Change-the-interval-settings"><a href="#Step3-Change-the-interval-settings" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Change the interval settings"></a>Step3 Change the interval settings</h5><p>Choosing the correct interval settings is essential to creating a professional-looking time-lapse video. The interval time is the amount of time between each frame in your video. 30 FPS is used by GoPro time-lapse which means 30 pictures are required for a one-second video. The first step to shooting a GoPro time-lapse video is choosing the interval settings.</p><p>This can be done through GoPro’s settings menu, which can be accessed by tapping the icon in the upper right corner of the main screen, then tapping “Settings” in the menu that appears. the camera will take pictures every few seconds while recording video, which is great if you’re trying to hit a certain number of frames per second (FPS).</p><h5 id="Step4-Mount-your-GoPro-and-click-on-the-shutter-button"><a href="#Step4-Mount-your-GoPro-and-click-on-the-shutter-button" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Mount your GoPro and click on the shutter button"></a>Step4 Mount your GoPro and click on the shutter button</h5><p>If you want to shoot time-lapse videos on a GoPro, first you’ll need to mount your camera. Then press the shutter button on your camera and start shooting. Attach the camera to the tripod with the adhesive mount provided. Set up your camera by adjusting the settings for exposure, ISO, and other options in the Settings menu (you can find these settings in the Settings tab)</p><p>You’ll probably want to use a wide-angle lens for this kind of video because you’ll want to capture as much of your surroundings as possible. If you want to change the length of time you want to shoot, press the button again until it says “Time Lapse” or whatever setting you want.</p><h5 id="Step5-Press-the-Shutter-Button-to-End-Shooting"><a href="#Step5-Press-the-Shutter-Button-to-End-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Press the Shutter Button to End Shooting"></a>Step5 Press the Shutter Button to End Shooting</h5><p>When you are done with your shooting press the shutter button to end the shooting. GoPro will automatically combine all your clicked photos in a single video. You don’t need to do anything to combine the photos. The best part about this camera is that you can use it to shoot both vertical and horizontal time-lapses, as well as time-lapse photos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033101&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Elite.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Edit-Time-lapse-Video-on-Computer"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Edit-Time-lapse-Video-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on Computer"></a>Part 3: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on Computer</h2><p>Editing time-lapse videos can be a bit tricky, but with the right tools and a little bit of practice, you can create some stunning time-lapse videos that will amaze your friends and family.

In case you have already such a thing on your device or in the Canva library, you should open it in the editor’s interface. After that, you should work on adding audio files.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Upload Audio</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/canva-video-2.png"                      alt="Audio upload to Canva"                ></p><p>Secondly, you should proceed with a small procedure of uploading audio files to the Canva. Canva allows uploading any kind of file from external sources or devices. It can be useful in adding desired audio and sound effects to the video. For such a thing, you can see the UPLOAD tab in the menu. You should visit the tab and click the UPLOAD MEDIA button.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Pick Audio File</strong></p><p>When you click the button, it will lead to a device folder interface.

Here, you should visit the AUDIO tab from the side panel. In case you cannot see such an option, you will definitely get the MORE button, so, proceed by clicking it. After exploring more, you can easily see that particular button.</p><p><strong>Step 5:Add Audio To Design</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/canva-video-4.png"                      alt="add audio to design"                ></p><p>In the audio tab, you can see the recently uploaded final.

Generally, it is considered as an edit symbol that will allow you to access the complete edit panel without any problem.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Launch Editor And Edit</strong></p><p>You should click the edit icon and launch the respective interface. In case you want to trim the audio, you can use left and right brackets and drag them to the positions. The left bracket will help you decide the starting point and the right one help you pick the ending point. By using both, you can pick a section that you want to add to the video.</p><p>If you like to chop the audio, you should choose the section by using the scissors icon. The selected audio section will be removed and the remaining can be added to the video. As for the editor features, you can also apply fades to the audio. It will help you to mix different audios or create some low moments in the video.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Preview</strong></p><p>After making all these edits on video and audio, you should merge both files. Before proceeding to the final step, it will be good if you consider a preview. Preview will help you understand the video is created perfectly or not. In case there’s any kind of issue with the video, you will get it during preview and fix it immediately.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Save &amp; Download</strong></p><p>In case you are satisfied with the preview results, you should click the SAVE or SAVE A COPY button. You can also download the file to get it on your device and share it on other platforms.</p><p>It is the complete procedure that will help you to edit an audio file on Canva with ease.</p><h3 id="Important-Tip-Try-Filmora"><a href="#Important-Tip-Try-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Important Tip: Try Filmora"></a>Important Tip: Try Filmora</h3><p>In case you are interested in using a good video editor with a user-friendly interface and easy-to-use procedures, you should be focused on choosing Filmora.

But, if you’ve ever shot any film on a smartphone or a digital camera, you’ve probably observed the colors you see in real life don’t always match up to what you want to see on your screen. In this article, you will grasp how and when to use the color grading process by stylizing the color scheme of your footage and its importance in your everyday film and video projects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-panel-filmora.jpg"                      alt="color grading panel filmora"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-Color-Grading"><a href="#What-is-Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="What is Color Grading?"></a>What is Color Grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the video editing process wherein grading (arranging) colors in a video or film to give them a stylistic look. It is different from Color correction because color correction is the process of correcting (fixing) colors in a video or a film as a way to get them back to what they should look like for your project or output.</p><p>In cinematography, color grading refers to the manipulation of film and video images to create consistent color tones throughout a motion picture. Many filmmakers use a color palette or preset as part of their overall production plan. These palettes represent artistic choices that provide the film with a cohesive general aspect. When film footage does not adequately match these color palettes, directors and colorists use digital color grading tools to change video colors as needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/origianl-video-color-grading.jpg"                      alt="origianl video color grading"                ></p><p>Color grading and color correction are processes that happen throughout postproduction. One makes the film look more native, and the other stylizes the footage. After the colorist finishes color correction, they can begin grading the film. During color grading, colorists use editing software to formalize the footage, highlighting a movie’s visual tone and ambiance and making it look more cinematic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-color-grading-to-video.jpg"                      alt="apply color grading to video"                ></p><p>To summarize, Color grading can be used to make both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color grading for artistic purposes to ensure that the film’s carefully curated color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion.</p><h2 id="Why-is-Color-Grading-Important"><a href="#Why-is-Color-Grading-Important" class="headerlink" title="Why is Color Grading Important?"></a>Why is Color Grading Important?</h2><p><strong>Color grading establish a picture’s first impression</strong></p><p>Most images are initially seen as rushed by in one of the infinite scrolls that fill social media or in small thumbnails in galleries. In these circumstances, perfect skin retouching or flawless exposure means very little. Users do not even recognize the image in enough detail with these varieties of an object. Color grading, however, stands out within the condition of these formats. An excellent color-graded image that implores the viewer will drive them to stop and take a closer look. As a photographer, you need support in learning how to grade your ideas so that they will grab viewers’ attention in a fleeting second among the chaotic noise of the digital age.</p><p><strong>It communicates the atmosphere to tune with the scene</strong></p><p>The communication of emotion and story through the lens is one of the most powerful tools a photographer has at their disposal. The grading of a well-graded image can often augment the sense of story within a scene or even completely transform it. Without the grading, an image may look flat, boring, or even disjointed. As a photographer becomes more proficient at grading, he or she can leverage the power of color tone to influence emotional tone within a scene. Grading at this level can transform an unexciting frame into a moment of cinematic magic.</p><p><strong>Color grading encourage a style that can be completely your own</strong></p><p>One of the most intimidating challenges a photographer or vlogger faces is creating a unique style that can result in a brand for their work. Making a visual style that viewers can recognize at a glance can tremendously impact the growth of a photographer’s career. Color grading plays a vital part in that process. Customers will often come to you with a wide range of different photography outputs. By defining a consistent color grading work, you can tie it all into a dense brand that reflects strongly on you and construct a distinctive value that provides you something to sell that only you can offer to people.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-use-Color-Grading-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-use-Color-Grading-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to use Color Grading in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>How to use Color Grading in Wondershare Filmora?</h2><p>There are many color grading software available on your Windows PC or Mac.

There are, of course, a lot of 3 Dimensional effects allowing you to transform the image of your video as promised.</p><p><strong>HSL</strong></p><p>HSL is the acronym for hue, saturation, and luminosity. It is cylindrical geometry, where you mix the different colors and adjust their intensities to get the accurate mix you are eyeing for in your video.

But, if you want to have a better experience, you will need more. A research and test results reveal that Periscope requires 10.4 MB for viewing a 2 minutes video on an average that is equal to <strong>5.2MB</strong> per minute.

To reach the heights in broadcasting, the following streaming habits are essential to follow. With the increase in online video streaming and people getting more and more hooked on the live videos, try to follow the points below for a faster live streaming experience for your audiences.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Delete-Cache-Files-On-Your-Phone"><a href="#Part-4-Delete-Cache-Files-On-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Delete Cache Files On Your Phone"></a>Part 4: Delete Cache Files On Your Phone</h2><p> The internet files and cache data covers a big space on your mobile phone. It weighs down your device making it heavy for any other videos to open. While closing a browser or a tab, the OS deletes thousands of small sized files that are automatically downloaded in order to open the web pages. When you do not close the browsers properly and shut down your device, the files stored automatically weighs down the browser, effecting faster live streaming and loading speed.
