This article lets you know the whole process of how you can activate a time travelling teleportation device using clever filming and editing in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Before filming and editing a video, get to know about the time-travel teleportation device.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Time-Travel-Teleportation-Device"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Time-Travel-Teleportation-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is a Time Travel Teleportation Device?"></a>Part 1. What Is a Time Travel Teleportation Device?</h2><p>Teleportation is usually estimated as the travelling between two points which carries unlimited time to complete. It’s always considered impossible to make time travel devices and use them in real life.</p><p>However, in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the time travelling teleportation devices are real. It just needs some DIY filming hacks and an editing tool. Let’s start to take shots and get into it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Part-2-Filming-Prerequisites-for-Time-Travelling-Effects"><a href="#Part-2-Filming-Prerequisites-for-Time-Travelling-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Filming Prerequisites for Time Travelling Effects"></a>Part 2. Filming Prerequisites for Time Travelling Effects</h2><p>To create shots, we have to do two processing rounds. In the first round, we will film a shot for daytime activity. While in the next round, we will shoot a video for nighttime activity. Get straight into the filming mode and create according to your script.</p><h3 id="1-daylight-lighting-setup"><a href="#1-daylight-lighting-setup" class="headerlink" title="#1 daylight lighting setup"></a>#1 daylight lighting setup</h3><p>In this round, you have to create a daytime action, implying that you need daylight. As well as, you don’t need professional filming skills because it is going to be so simple.</p><p>Catch us at the below tips to make your video shots more skilled! First, you need a Lightning set, in which blue light is used to film the first shot. Because in this shot, we need daylight, and as you know, blue-ish lighting is usually used to intimate the daylight.</p><p>You can also use a light that is 5,600 kelvins, which indicates blue light. We can easily change the light from its remote, as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/blue-light-lighting-setup.jpg"                      alt="blue light lighting setup"                ></p><p>If you don’t have an asset to get the lighting set up, then don’t worry; we have another option.</p><p><strong>Make colorful shots with plastic binders</strong></p><p>Professional videographers create these effects using high-end lighting. But you don’t have to buy any pricey equipment. Because colored plastic binder dividers or cellophane wrapping can be used to easily create colorful photos.</p><p>First, wrap the colorful divider around the LED light or any other light you’re using to take video. The dividers will be melt or burn when the light source gets too hot; therefore, check the temperature of the light after short gaps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/wrap-the-led-light-with-a-plastic-binder.jpg"                      alt="wrap the led light with a plastic binder"                ></p><ul><li>Shoot the video now, and experiment with adding suspense, terror, and cheerful effects with various colors.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/final-results-after-changing-led-light-by-colorful-binders.jpg"                      alt="final results after changing led light by colorful binders"                ></p><p>After setting the lights, now it’s time to check the camera!</p><p><strong>Camera alignment</strong></p><p>It is a very important step that you don’t have to change the camera position during filming. Because if the camera angle will not be same, it’s difficult to show in the same alignment during editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/camera-alignment.gif"                      alt="camera alignment"                ></p><p>After setting all equipment, now it’s time to allow the character to perform in front of the camera.</p><p><strong>Character position</strong></p><p>For the first round, the subject has to do acting for the daytime script. Let the character do their performance according to the screenplay.</p><p>In this article, we are doing a daytime performance in the first round. For this, the subject should go from right to left to step over for night time dimension.</p><h3 id="1-night-time-lighting-setup"><a href="#1-night-time-lighting-setup" class="headerlink" title="#1 night-time lighting setup"></a>#1 night-time lighting setup</h3><p>In the second round, you have to create a nighttime action indicating that you need a night light. You have to change the costume of a subject as well as you can change the set too.</p><p>To film a night mode, you need a warmer light, which is used to make shots for the second round. You can also use a light that is under 2700-3000 kelvins because it indicates warm light.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/night-time-warmer-light.jpg"                      alt="night time warmer light"                ></p><p>You don’t need to worry if you don’t have enough budget to get this setup. Because plastic binders will make your way easy, and you can create your own at home, as told earlier.</p><p><strong>Character performance</strong></p><p>For the second round, the subject has to change the costume according to nighttime. Then the character has to perform according to the script.</p><p>In this round, the subject should start from the right to left and perform stepping over to the nighttime dimension. This action should remain on the left side of the crossline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                      alt="note"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure to match the <strong>“stepping over”</strong> of the character for better results in the transition video.</p><h3 id="3-cross-line-between-two-rounds"><a href="#3-cross-line-between-two-rounds" class="headerlink" title="#3 cross line between two rounds"></a>#3 cross line between two rounds</h3><p>For a transition, you have to insert a line between two rounds. It will identify the difference between the two timelines. We will use the middle line of the frame as a cross line for reference in this article.</p><p>You can also create a marking by using anything in yours. We are using the midline of the sofa for marking the cross line, as shown below. This will also make a lot of help during editing on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/marking-for-the-cross-line-of-transitions.jpg"                      alt="marking for the cross line of transitions"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                      alt="note"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure to match the <strong>“stepping over”</strong> of the character for better results in the transition video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/cross-line-between-two-rounds.jpg"                      alt="cross line between two rounds"                ></p><p>After shooting all the clips, it’s time to edit them on Filmora.

Filming Prerequisites for Time Travelling Effects"></a>Part 2. Filming Prerequisites for Time Travelling Effects</h2><p>To create shots, we have to do two processing rounds. In the first round, we will film a shot for daytime activity. While in the next round, we will shoot a video for nighttime activity. Get straight into the filming mode and create according to your script.</p><h3 id="1-daylight-lighting-setup-1"><a href="#1-daylight-lighting-setup-1" class="headerlink" title="#1 daylight lighting setup"></a>#1 daylight lighting setup</h3><p>In this round, you have to create a daytime action, implying that you need daylight. As well as, you don’t need professional filming skills because it is going to be so simple.</p><p>Catch us at the below tips to make your video shots more skilled! First, you need a Lightning set, in which blue light is used to film the first shot. Because in this shot, we need daylight, and as you know, blue-ish lighting is usually used to intimate the daylight.</p><p>You can also use a light that is 5,600 kelvins, which indicates blue light. We can easily change the light from its remote, as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/blue-light-lighting-setup.jpg"                      alt="blue light lighting setup"                ></p><p>If you don’t have an asset to get the lighting set up, then don’t worry; we have another option.</p><p><strong>Make colorful shots with plastic binders</strong></p><p>Professional videographers create these effects using high-end lighting. But you don’t have to buy any pricey equipment. Because colored plastic binder dividers or cellophane wrapping can be used to easily create colorful photos.</p><p>First, wrap the colorful divider around the LED light or any other light you’re using to take video. The dividers will be melt or burn when the light source gets too hot; therefore, check the temperature of the light after short gaps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/wrap-the-led-light-with-a-plastic-binder.jpg"                      alt="wrap the led light with a plastic binder"                ></p><ul><li>Shoot the video now, and experiment with adding suspense, terror, and cheerful effects with various colors.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/final-results-after-changing-led-light-by-colorful-binders.jpg"                      alt="final results after changing led light by colorful binders"                ></p><p>After setting the lights, now it’s time to check the camera!</p><p><strong>Camera alignment</strong></p><p>It is a very important step that you don’t have to change the camera position during filming. Because if the camera angle will not be same, it’s difficult to show in the same alignment during editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/camera-alignment.gif"                      alt="camera alignment"                ></p><p>After setting all equipment, now it’s time to allow the character to perform in front of the camera.</p><p><strong>Character position</strong></p><p>For the first round, the subject has to do acting for the daytime script. Let the character do their performance according to the screenplay.</p><p>In this article, we are doing a daytime performance in the first round. For this, the subject should go from right to left to step over for night time dimension.</p><h3 id="1-night-time-lighting-setup-1"><a href="#1-night-time-lighting-setup-1" class="headerlink" title="#1 night-time lighting setup"></a>#1 night-time lighting setup</h3><p>In the second round, you have to create a nighttime action indicating that you need a night light. You have to change the costume of a subject as well as you can change the set too.</p><p>To film a night mode, you need a warmer light, which is used to make shots for the second round. You can also use a light that is under 2700-3000 kelvins because it indicates warm light.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/night-time-warmer-light.jpg"                      alt="night time warmer light"                ></p><p>You don’t need to worry if you don’t have enough budget to get this setup. Because plastic binders will make your way easy, and you can create your own at home, as told earlier.</p><p><strong>Character performance</strong></p><p>For the second round, the subject has to change the costume according to nighttime. Then the character has to perform according to the script.</p><p>In this round, the subject should start from the right to left and perform stepping over to the nighttime dimension. This action should remain on the left side of the crossline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                      alt="note"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure to match the <strong>“stepping over”</strong> of the character for better results in the transition video.</p><h3 id="3-cross-line-between-two-rounds-1"><a href="#3-cross-line-between-two-rounds-1" class="headerlink" title="#3 cross line between two rounds"></a>#3 cross line between two rounds</h3><p>For a transition, you have to insert a line between two rounds. It will identify the difference between the two timelines. We will use the middle line of the frame as a cross line for reference in this article.</p><p>You can also create a marking by using anything in yours. We are using the midline of the sofa for marking the cross line, as shown below.

How to use Luts from color grading central to color grading for movies?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-central-2.jpg"                      alt="color grading for movies"                ></p><p>Color grading is one way to enhance the look of your shots and serve your narrative vision. That’s why many filmmakers, editors, and colorists working on film use Look Up Tables, or LUTs, to store color grades as templates to help speed up the process.</p><p>We’re letting you know that you don’t have to work on the film to use LUTs to help personalize and mark your videos. If you’re wondering how you can get started with color grading to speed up your workflow and create better-looking shots for your business, we’ve got you covered.</p><p><strong>LUTs in Movies</strong></p><p>Various LUT types are employed during post-production for color grading and color correction.</p><p>First, the two LUT formats work differently. <strong>A 1D LUT</strong> (usually. lut format) controls a single parameter, generally gamma. A 1D LUT takes a sort of blanket approach; the adjustment applies to everything in the image without much flexibility. One parameter affects all colors, saturations, and contrast. <strong>A 3D LUT</strong> (usually a. cube format) has three axes that independently adjust Hue, Saturation, Luminance, Gamma, and Contrast and can change as conditions in the image change. As such, a 3D LUT is much more flexible and powerful and is the only way to achieve a truly cinematic color grade with LUT.</p><p>The other two types of LUTs can be either 1D or 3D LUTs, but these days they are most often 3D LUTs. The difference between them is when in the process you use them and for what purpose.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-central-3.jpg"                      alt="luts in movies"                ></p><p>An input or camera LUT used at the beginning of the color correction process adjusts the footage so that the color correction tools work correctly. Color corrected recordings that require an input or camera LUT without one can lead to unexpected and unsatisfactory results.</p><p>Conversely, you typically apply a LUT look after you’ve done color correction and moved on to the color grading phase. Use it to dial in the exact artistic look you want. The Look LUT contains instructions to create a predetermined desired look for your shots, which can be an incredible time saver in the color grading process.</p><p>Always colorize an appearance LUT correctly before applying it, as appearance LUTs assume an underlying natural color. If you don’t, you may not see the results that the LUT is supposed to give you.</p><p>LUTs are specially designed for different recording types – LOG, RAW, Rec.709, Rec.2020, HDR, and more. You can apply any LUT to any footage, but if you apply a LUT designed for a specific type of footage to another type, you can end up with a very different look than what you expected. But then it can also give you a result you like, so you are free to experiment as you wish. LUTs are non-destructive, so you can load and delete them at will.</p><p>Many camera manufacturers, software companies, and independent producers offer downloadable LUTs or LUT packs. They often design these skins for specific purposes, such as color correcting footage captured by their cameras or to mimic signature skins seen in movies and TV shows. These skins can give you exactly the color class you want, or you can use them and keep tweaking and tweaking to get the perfect look.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Free-LUTs-sources"><a href="#Part-3-Free-LUTs-sources" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Free LUTs sources"></a>Part 3. Free LUTs sources</h2><p>Cinematic LUTs are pre-saved settings that make color grading easy and efficient, allowing you to enhance your videos with just a few clicks. By using a color tinting effect, changing the brightness of the video, or richer colors, you will achieve professional results in no time, regardless of the software product you are using.</p><p>LUTs are shared in the .cube file format, which is supported by the most popular video editors, such as DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro CC, After Effects CC, and Sony Vegas.</p><h3 id="1-Ground-Control-Color-13-Free-LUTs"><a href="#1-Ground-Control-Color-13-Free-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="1.

So iON Air Pro can be rated as a good choice for surfing needs but when it comes to diving then you have to look at GoPro.<br> The package includes decent accessories such as universal power adapter, USB cable and mounts. Even if you want to buy few additional accessories then they can be obtained with much cheaper price tag as compared to GoPro collections. The mount upgrade options include surfboards, handle bars and headbands. On the front side you will find a f2.8 fog free lens with 16 mm dimensions.</li><li><strong>Video and Photo Quality:</strong><br> The iON Air Pro 3 device can serve users with 1080p resolution level at 30 fps frame rate settings. The maximum supported bit rate with this mode is 12 Mbps. You can easily switch to 720p with 120 fps, 30fps and 60 fps frame rate settings where bit rate increases up to 22 Mbps. The best thing to know is its ability to record a secondary thumbnail at WQVGA resolution level during 1080p resolution setting, this file can be easily uploaded on internet and can be shared immediately with other devices. In case if you are working with remote application then supported resolution settings are 720p&#x2F;30fps and 1080p&#x2F; 30 fps, the mode gets automatically selected depending upon resolution switch position. Videos can be easily captured at 160 degree wide angle type view. Further, it can be adjusted to obtain little tighter details with 140 and 150 degree focus. This fixed focus type lens is best from 3.3 feet and ranges perfectly up to infinity thus you need to maintain proper space between subject and camera.<br> It can capture stills at 12Mp and 5MP resolution level while serving with 4:3 aspect ratio. Users can prefer to switch between time lapse and burst modes with interval selection of 60, 30. 10, 5 and 2 for the first case and 10 shot type settings in case of burst mode.</li><li><strong>Wi-Fi and Application:</strong><br> It is much simpler to access Wi-Fi settings with this device.

But the good news is that this non removable battery makes it a compact action camera with waterproof body so that it can be easily used in tough situations. With 1080p resolution level it can record easily up to 2.5 hours. On the other side, the supported Micro SD card goes up to 64 GB capacity. Thus you can easily store a shoot of 4 hours 20 minute length if working on 1080p at 60 fps rating. Additionally, you will be able to obtain 8GB additional space from MiMedia that can be easily used for sharing videos or photos online.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p> This bullet shaped camera is right option for you if you are searching for something having features close to Toshiba or GoPro designs. The Wi-Fi PODZ adds flexibility to controls and accessibility. As the box include only few basic mounts so you may have to spend little extra to get the remaining ones from market. This device is best rated for helmet mount needs. The excellent video quality along with ease of operation and wide angle focus make it first choice under affordable action cam model category. You don’t need to spend on a waterproof case but apps are yet to be improved to enhance flexibility.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-audible-brilliance-the-ultimate-mic-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  Audible Brilliance  The Ultimate Mic Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-blur-out-not-into-discovering-photo-clarity-web-tools/"><u>[New] Blur Out, Not Into!

Researching all the numerous possibilities and choosing the appropriate service for you can be a mammoth process, leaving many people merely choosing one of the major brands, like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. The regular SSD or hard drive can no longer suffice with the quantity of data that needs to be stored, so the only option is to subscribe to a possible cloud storage service. The best way to store data in the cloud is through cloud storage, accessed from any location and device.</p><p>We’ve evaluated all the various cloud storage out there and put up this cloud storage comparison to make the task simpler. If you want to save money on storage, <strong>cloud storage pricing</strong> is essential when choosing the best cloud storage service provider.</p><p>So, read on as we discuss <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> below:</p><h2 id="Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison"><a href="#Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison"></a>Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison</h2><p>Here is a table comparing top cloud storage providers’ free storage space and their <strong>cloud storage pricing comparison</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Cloud Storage Providers</th><th>Free Storage</th><th>Monthly Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apple iCloud</td><td>5GB</td><td>50GB - $1200GB - $32TB - $10</td></tr><tr><td>Google Drive</td><td>15GB</td><td>100GB - $7.49250GB - $10500GB - $18.95</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB - $21TB - $72TB - $12</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB of storage for $2 per month or $20 annually</td></tr><tr><td>Dropbox</td><td>2GB</td><td>Plus: 2TB - $10Family: 2TB - $17.</td></tr><tr><td>pCloud</td><td>10GB</td><td>500GB - $50 a year2TB - $100 a year10TB - Custom</td></tr><tr><td>Sync.com</td><td>5GB</td><td>1TB - $6Unlimited - $15</td></tr><tr><td>Icedrive</td><td>10GB</td><td>150GB - $1.671TB - $4.175TB - $15</td></tr></tbody></table><p>However, Google Drive and Photos are already fine if you don’t wish to invest much money. For example, you can use Google Photos to store photos in the cloud.</p><p>The security and privacy of cloud services are crucial, correct storage capacity and device compatibility.</p><p>If security is your top priority, choose Sync.com, IceDrive, and pCloud. They are the most robust encryption and authentication system for cloud storage.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Price-Recommendations"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Price-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Price Recommendations"></a>Part 2: Best Price Recommendations</h2><p>Here we recommend the cloud storage services with the best prices in three categories.</p><h3 id="1-Best-price-of-lifetime-license-cloud-storage"><a href="#1-Best-price-of-lifetime-license-cloud-storage" class="headerlink" title="1.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Achieving-Studio-Quality-with-Audacity"><a href="#Achieving-Studio-Quality-with-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Achieving Studio Quality with Audacity"></a>Achieving Studio Quality with Audacity</h2><p>Most users choose for Voice Memos on Mac or Sound Recorder on PC when they wish to capture audio on their computer. However, despite the fact that these tools let you record audio using the microphone, they lack the features needed for more sophisticated audio recording and editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Audacity-add-audio.jpg"                      alt="record profeesional audio"                ></p><p>Therefore, the majority of users think of Audacity when they wish to record and edit high-quality audio on their PCs. Most people use this open-source audio recorder as their go-to tool because it is totally free to use.</p><p>However, due to its large and difficult to comprehend interface, the majority of users find it difficult to operate. In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to quickly record your desktop using Audacity. Even if you’ve never used Audacity before, the procedures we explain here will make it simple for you to record audio of any length.</p><h2 id="1-Download-the-software"><a href="#1-Download-the-software" class="headerlink" title="1. Download the software"></a>1. Download the software</h2><p>Step1Go to your preferred browser and visit the official <a class="link"   href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >https://www.audacityteam.org/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using your preferred web browser.</p><p>Step2All the recording devices on your computer will be displayed in a drop-down menu. Choose the microphone you want to employ for the recording. Make sure the microphone is turned on and properly connected to the computer if you can’t see it.</p><p>Step3To choose the kind of track you want, click “Tracks” at the top of the page and then “Add New”. You can just select “Mono” or “Stereo” for the majority of straightforward projects.</p><p>Step4To begin the recording, simply click the “Record” button. As soon as you press record, an audio graph of your voice should start to display. Using the “Shift + R” hotkeys on your keyboard, you can add a new recording if you’d like to.</p><h2 id="2-Recording-using-Mac"><a href="#2-Recording-using-Mac" class="headerlink" title="2. Recording using Mac"></a>2. Recording using Mac</h2><p>To record audio on your Mac, you might need to install Audacity and additional plugins. The best option is to use the Soundflower program, which enables you to send sound to other apps rather than your computer’s speakers. Here’s how to use Soundflower and Audacity to record audio on a Mac.</p><p>Step1The first step is to install Soundflower and Audacity on your Mac. It costs nothing to download either of these programs.</p><p>Step2The Soundflower app must then be set up. To achieve this, choose “Sounds” from the “System Preferences” menu. By choosing the Output tab, designate “Soundflower” as the sound output device (2ch). After that, launch the Sunflower app, and select the Flower icon in the menu bar to switch the built-in output to “Soundflower 2ch.”</p><p>Step3In the “Device” section of the Audacity preferences box, choose “Soundflower (2ch)”. From the recording area, choose “Software playthrough.” Click “OK” to save the options you’ve selected.</p><p>Step4Launch audacity, then open the app whose audio you wish to record. To begin the recording, click the “Record” button.</p><h2 id="3-Export-your-audio"><a href="#3-Export-your-audio" class="headerlink" title="3. Export your audio"></a>3. Export your audio</h2><p>It’s time to export the finished file after finishing up your Audacity project’s modification. It’s crucial to realize that simply saving your Audacity project doesn’t produce a file that you can share with others.</p><p>You’ll need to do a process known as exporting in order to produce a file that you can distribute and publish to your podcast host, Spotify, or other audio distribution sites. Fortunately, everything is quite easy. Let’s examine Audacity’s exporting procedure.</p><p>Do the following in Audacity to export audio:</p><ol><li>Activate the file menu</li><li>Then click “Export”</li><li>Choose the solution that best suits your needs</li></ol><p>There are already preset options for. MP3,.WAV, and OGG files. If you require any of them, go ahead and choose the appropriate choice.</p><p>You can select from a variety of additional file formats, including FLAC, M4A, WMA, and more, if you select the “Export Audio…” option. But for these, you might need to install FFMPEG as mentioned in this article.</p><p>Simply select the necessary file format from the drop-down box that appears next to “Save as type:” In a moment, we’ll delve deeper into some of the advanced settings.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/essential-tips-for-photosvideos-in-windows-10/"><u>Essential Tips for Photos/Videos in Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/professional-stabilization-tech-for-youtube-content-creators/"><u>Professional Stabilization Tech for YouTube Content Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/film-editing-expertise-exchange/"><u>Film Editing Expertise Exchange</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/mastering-easy-underwater-film-making-top-7-hacks/"><u>Mastering Easy Underwater Film-Making  Top 7 Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/a-tale-of-two-streamers-twitchs-faceoff-with-youtube/"><u>A Tale of Two Streamers  Twitch's Faceoff with YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-outstanding-color-grading-top-11/"><u>A Step-by-Step Guide to Outstanding Color Grading (Top 11)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-advanced-text-tools-and-ae-plug-ins/"><u>2024 Approved  Advanced Text Tools & AE Plug-Ins</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/digital-delivery-diary-poker-perspectives/"><u>DIGITAL DELIVERY DIARY  Poker Perspectives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-social-media-savvy-tips-and-tricks-for-captivating-storytelling/"><u>[New] In 2024, Social Media Savvy  Tips and Tricks for Captivating Storytelling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-premier-visionaries-in-multimedia-creation/"><u>[Updated] Premier Visionaries in Multimedia Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/resolve-deceptive-user-appearance-within-chat-environments-for-2024/"><u>Resolve Deceptive User Appearance Within Chat Environments for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-leveraging-vimeos-end-credits-for-visual-impact-for-2024/"><u>[New] Leveraging Vimeo's End Credits for Visual Impact for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/elevate-your-conversations-pro-level-whatsapp-tips-for-2024/"><u>Elevate Your Conversations  Pro-Level WhatsApp Tips for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-jumpstart-with-vrecorder-easy-installation-walkthrough/"><u>2024 Approved  Jumpstart with VRecorder  Easy Installation Walkthrough</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/infinite-views-looping-videos-on-your-iphone/"><u>Infinite Views  Looping Videos on Your iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-simple-and-effective-ways-to-change-your-country-on-youtube-app-of-your-nokia-c22-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Simple and Effective Ways to Change Your Country on YouTube App Of your Nokia C22 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-beginners-guide-to-changing-speed-up-in-videos-on-snapchat/"><u>2024 Approved  Beginner’s Guide to Changing Speed Up in Videos on Snapchat</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Accelerate-Office-Productivity-with-Speech-Recognition-Word"><a href="#Accelerate-Office-Productivity-with-Speech-Recognition-Word" class="headerlink" title="Accelerate Office Productivity with Speech Recognition (Word)"></a>Accelerate Office Productivity with Speech Recognition (Word)</h2><p>Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text tool is helpful for people who spend a lot of time using the program and don’t want to strain their fingers or keyboard with all of that typing. While Microsoft Word’s text-to-speech technology used to be prone to errors that needed correcting later, it has advanced considerably in recent years and is now among the best in the business.</p><p>Whether you have the best Windows laptop or Mac—Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text is simple to discover and use. You’ll find all you need to know about connecting your microphone and inserting punctuation in this manual, from the first steps to the more complex aspects.</p><p>Here’s how to use Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text feature:</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Top Recommendation: Wondershare Filmora</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Evernote Speech-To-Text</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Google Docs Speech-To-Text</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">FAQs</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Use-Speech-to-Text-in-Microsoft-Word"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Use-Speech-to-Text-in-Microsoft-Word" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Use Speech to Text in Microsoft Word?"></a>Part 1: How to Use Speech to Text in Microsoft Word?</h2><p>Before you can use Speech to Text in Microsoft Word, the first thing you need is a valid Microsoft 365 subscription. Without a Microsoft 365 subscription, Microsoft won’t allow you to use voice typing. However, if you’re working for a company, it’s likely that your company already has a Microsoft 365 enterprise subscription. If you’re a student or your company doesn’t offer it, the subscription plans are pretty affordable. For example, Microsoft 365 Personal and Microsoft 365 Family plans cost $6.99&#x2F;month and $9.99&#x2F;month, respectively.</p><p>The second thing you need is a dependable internet connection. The reason is Microsoft Word’s dictation software works on remote servers to interpret your words. These enormous servers and lightning-fast processors require a large amount of speech data to transcribe your text. In reality, the program uses sophisticated neural networks and deep machine learning technology to ensure that it understands the nuances of human speech. These two technologies have helped voice typing technology evolve rapidly in recent years, which is why an internet connection is necessary.</p><p>Now let’s start typing:</p><h5 id="Step1Open-Microsoft-Word"><a href="#Step1Open-Microsoft-Word" class="headerlink" title="Step1Open Microsoft Word"></a>Step1Open Microsoft Word</h5><p>Create a new, empty document in Microsoft Word on your device. Name your document and save it on the desktop or wherever you like it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-1.jpg"                      alt="open microsoft word"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Click-on-the-Dictate-button"><a href="#Step2Click-on-the-Dictate-button" class="headerlink" title="Step2Click on the Dictate button"></a>Step2Click on the Dictate button</h5><p>When you first open a new document, go to the top right corner of the Home menu includes a Dictate button and a drop-down menu. It has a microphone symbol above it. Double-check that the language is set to English using the drop-down menu. Choose English or any of the supported languages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-2.jpg"                      alt="click on the dictate button"                ></p><p>Microsoft Word Speech to Text tool supports many languages as well languages that have multiple variants, such as English and French. In addition, you can type on Microsoft Word in Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Taiwanese), English, French (France, Canada), German, Hindi, Italian, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil, Portugal), Russian, Spanish (Mexico, Spain), Thai, and more.</p><h5 id="Step3Allow-Microsoft-Word-Access-to-the-Microphone"><a href="#Step3Allow-Microsoft-Word-Access-to-the-Microphone" class="headerlink" title="Step3Allow Microsoft Word Access to the Microphone"></a>Step3Allow Microsoft Word Access to the Microphone</h5><p>If you’ve never used Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text engine on Windows PC before, you’ll need to allow the program access to your microphone. This may be completed with a single click when prompted. You can use your laptop’s built-in microphone or connect an external one. But, we suggest you use an external microphone for improved accuracy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-3.jpg"                      alt="allow microsoft word access to the microphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-4.jpg"                      alt="use speech to text"                ></p><p>Follow these steps to activate the microphone in Mac.</p><p>To turn voice dictation on or off:</p><ul><li>Select Apple &gt; System Preferences</li><li>Select View &gt; Dictation &amp; Speech</li><li>Click ON to enable Dictation or OFF to disable it</li></ul><h5 id="Step4Start-Dictating-Your-Document"><a href="#Step4Start-Dictating-Your-Document" class="headerlink" title="Step4Start Dictating Your Document"></a>Step4Start Dictating Your Document</h5><p>Once again, click the dictate button after completing all the preceding steps. The blue symbol will vanish, and a red recording symbol will appear, signifying that Microsoft Word has begun listening for your voice. A chime will sound if your sound is turned up, indicating that transcription has started. Say the words you want Microsoft to transcribe out loud. It may seem odd at first, but after a while, you’ll get a flow going, and everyone will find their own method for getting the most out of the program. To stop the recording, click on the microphone button again or press “Ctrl + Shift + S” on your keyboard. This will show the Stop Dictation dialogue box. From here, you can either save or cancel your work.</p><h5 id="Step5Using-Punctuation-Commands"><a href="#Step5Using-Punctuation-Commands" class="headerlink" title="Step5Using Punctuation Commands"></a>Step5Using Punctuation Commands</h5><p>Microsoft Word’s text-to-speech technology does more than simply transcribing your voice. Instead, Microsoft’s voice typing technology, which originally listened only to single words, now listens to individual words and the phrase as a whole, thanks to the advent and improvement of artificial neural networks. This has allowed Microsoft to develop a long list of commands for incorporating punctuation, symbols, and other formatting options into your text without saying anything out loud except for the command word itself. To see the list of commands, press “Ctrl + Shift + S” on your keyboard to open the Stop Dictation dialogue box, then click on the Commands button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-5.jpg"                      alt="using punctuation commands"                ></p><p>We can’t go through all of the punctuation instructions here, but we’ll mention a few of the most important. For example, the command “period” inserts a period, and “comma” creates a comma, as you may guess. The same rules apply to exclamation marks and colons. In addition, you may use the command “new line” to create a new line, “new paragraph” to start a new paragraph, and “tab” to create a tab space.</p><p>If you want to insert symbols, the commands are a bit different. For example, saying “open parenthesis” will automatically insert an opening parenthesis, but you’ll need to say “close parenthesis” to get a closing parenthesis. The same goes for brackets, braces, and quotation marks.</p><p>Microsoft’s speech-to-text program is excellent. We can honestly state that Microsoft has the most refined product when it comes to cost vs performance because the software is integrated directly into Microsoft 365, which many businesses already use.

Without a Microsoft 365 subscription, Microsoft won’t allow you to use voice typing. However, if you’re working for a company, it’s likely that your company already has a Microsoft 365 enterprise subscription. If you’re a student or your company doesn’t offer it, the subscription plans are pretty affordable. For example, Microsoft 365 Personal and Microsoft 365 Family plans cost $6.99&#x2F;month and $9.99&#x2F;month, respectively.</p><p>The second thing you need is a dependable internet connection. The reason is Microsoft Word’s dictation software works on remote servers to interpret your words. These enormous servers and lightning-fast processors require a large amount of speech data to transcribe your text. In reality, the program uses sophisticated neural networks and deep machine learning technology to ensure that it understands the nuances of human speech. These two technologies have helped voice typing technology evolve rapidly in recent years, which is why an internet connection is necessary.</p><p>Now let’s start typing:</p><h5 id="Step1Open-Microsoft-Word-1"><a href="#Step1Open-Microsoft-Word-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1Open Microsoft Word"></a>Step1Open Microsoft Word</h5><p>Create a new, empty document in Microsoft Word on your device. Name your document and save it on the desktop or wherever you like it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-1.jpg"                      alt="open microsoft word"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Click-on-the-Dictate-button-1"><a href="#Step2Click-on-the-Dictate-button-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2Click on the Dictate button"></a>Step2Click on the Dictate button</h5><p>When you first open a new document, go to the top right corner of the Home menu includes a Dictate button and a drop-down menu. It has a microphone symbol above it. Double-check that the language is set to English using the drop-down menu. Choose English or any of the supported languages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-2.jpg"                      alt="click on the dictate button"                ></p><p>Microsoft Word Speech to Text tool supports many languages as well languages that have multiple variants, such as English and French. In addition, you can type on Microsoft Word in Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Taiwanese), English, French (France, Canada), German, Hindi, Italian, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil, Portugal), Russian, Spanish (Mexico, Spain), Thai, and more.</p><h5 id="Step3Allow-Microsoft-Word-Access-to-the-Microphone-1"><a href="#Step3Allow-Microsoft-Word-Access-to-the-Microphone-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3Allow Microsoft Word Access to the Microphone"></a>Step3Allow Microsoft Word Access to the Microphone</h5><p>If you’ve never used Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text engine on Windows PC before, you’ll need to allow the program access to your microphone. This may be completed with a single click when prompted. You can use your laptop’s built-in microphone or connect an external one. But, we suggest you use an external microphone for improved accuracy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-3.jpg"                      alt="allow microsoft word access to the microphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-4.jpg"                      alt="use speech to text"                ></p><p>Follow these steps to activate the microphone in Mac.</p><p>To turn voice dictation on or off:</p><ul><li>Select Apple &gt; System Preferences</li><li>Select View &gt; Dictation &amp; Speech</li><li>Click ON to enable Dictation or OFF to disable it</li></ul><h5 id="Step4Start-Dictating-Your-Document-1"><a href="#Step4Start-Dictating-Your-Document-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4Start Dictating Your Document"></a>Step4Start Dictating Your Document</h5><p>Once again, click the dictate button after completing all the preceding steps. The blue symbol will vanish, and a red recording symbol will appear, signifying that Microsoft Word has begun listening for your voice. A chime will sound if your sound is turned up, indicating that transcription has started. Say the words you want Microsoft to transcribe out loud. It may seem odd at first, but after a while, you’ll get a flow going, and everyone will find their own method for getting the most out of the program. To stop the recording, click on the microphone button again or press “Ctrl + Shift + S” on your keyboard. This will show the Stop Dictation dialogue box. From here, you can either save or cancel your work.</p><h5 id="Step5Using-Punctuation-Commands-1"><a href="#Step5Using-Punctuation-Commands-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5Using Punctuation Commands"></a>Step5Using Punctuation Commands</h5><p>Microsoft Word’s text-to-speech technology does more than simply transcribing your voice. Instead, Microsoft’s voice typing technology, which originally listened only to single words, now listens to individual words and the phrase as a whole, thanks to the advent and improvement of artificial neural networks. This has allowed Microsoft to develop a long list of commands for incorporating punctuation, symbols, and other formatting options into your text without saying anything out loud except for the command word itself. To see the list of commands, press “Ctrl + Shift + S” on your keyboard to open the Stop Dictation dialogue box, then click on the Commands button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-5.jpg"                      alt="using punctuation commands"                ></p><p>We can’t go through all of the punctuation instructions here, but we’ll mention a few of the most important. For example, the command “period” inserts a period, and “comma” creates a comma, as you may guess. The same rules apply to exclamation marks and colons. In addition, you may use the command “new line” to create a new line, “new paragraph” to start a new paragraph, and “tab” to create a tab space.</p><p>If you want to insert symbols, the commands are a bit different. For example, saying “open parenthesis” will automatically insert an opening parenthesis, but you’ll need to say “close parenthesis” to get a closing parenthesis. The same goes for brackets, braces, and quotation marks.</p><p>Microsoft’s speech-to-text program is excellent. We can honestly state that Microsoft has the most refined product when it comes to cost vs performance because the software is integrated directly into Microsoft 365, which many businesses already use. So if your company uses Microsoft 365, you may start utilizing the voice typing technology right now with no additional expenses.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Alternatives-to-Microsoft-Word-STT-1"><a href="#Part-2-Alternatives-to-Microsoft-Word-STT-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Alternatives to Microsoft Word STT"></a>Part 2: Alternatives to Microsoft Word STT</h2><p>There are some great alternative options to Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text feature.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Accelerating-Your-Creative-Process-High-Quality-3D-Models-Tools"><a href="#Accelerating-Your-Creative-Process-High-Quality-3D-Models-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Accelerating Your Creative Process: High-Quality 3D Models Tools"></a>Accelerating Your Creative Process: High-Quality 3D Models Tools</h2><p>Using software like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for editing your videos ready for uploading or release is fast and effective but first you have to get your files ready to import. We will be talking about 3d model creation today which is the first step in 3D animation creation. There are many options out there with their own advantages and drawbacks as well as price points and additional support via tutorials and in some cases assets to help speed up the creation process.</p><p>In every case you can always just buy ready-made models for your animations but in doing that you lose the option and the flexibility to have a completely custom asset with the ability to alter when needed.</p><p>There are many steps to creating that perfect video and in time you will have your preferred method. We call this our workflow. Achieving a comfortable workflow is one of the most important and influential processes you will undergo as a creative artist, this is due to the fact even with the best ideas and all the drive in the world, if you struggle to translate that into a 3d model then it stays in your head and no one will see it.</p><p>With this in mind let’s look at some of the options available to us and how we can use them for this first most important step in our creative process. Remember to pick one that does not limit your creativity and gives you the tools you need to translate thought into visualization.</p><h2 id="ZBrush-by-MAXON"><a href="#ZBrush-by-MAXON" class="headerlink" title="ZBrush by MAXON "></a>ZBrush by MAXON <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/zbrush-by-maxon.jpg"                      alt="zbrush by maxon"                ></h2><p>Zbrush is what is considered an industry standard 3D modeling software and is one of the most used by many leading studios. This is a paid software with different versions meeting different needs depending on what you feel you need. You can create impressive 3d models with very high levels of detail without overusing your computer resources resulting in a stable and fluid working process. Zbrush is very powerful with many features, too many features to highlight in this guide but as an overview some features that can improve your process are:</p><ul><li>You can import or create alphas easily for micro detailing.</li><li>There is a live boolean to create unique items within your sculpts.</li><li>It’s very easy to use the Zremesher to create a new clean topology of your sculptures.<br> Dynamesh lets you work and retopo as you go so the sculpt retains detail.</li><li>Work with multiple levels of divisions at the same time with the Sub Divide tools.</li></ul><p>This is just a tiny scratch on the surface of what ZBrush can do. There are all the tools you need within this software to create an amazing jaw dropping model for your videos but this is a paid software which is important to remember when making the decision to go with this one as you will need animation and rigging software as well as in some cases a UV editor. Another thing to remember is system requirements depending on your setup. Minimum system requirements are as follows:</p><p><strong>For Windows:</strong></p><ul><li>64-bit Windows 10 or 11 .</li><li>Core 2 Duo or AMD equivalent with SSE2 technology or better.</li><li>4GB of ram with a strong recommendation for 6GB or more.</li><li>8GB of free hard drive space.</li><li>A graphics card with OpenGL 3.3 or higher and Vulkan 1.1 or higher.</li><li>Monitor with 32-bit color and a resolution of 1280x1024.</li><li>Mouse or Wacom compatible (WinTab API) pen tablet.</li></ul><p><strong>For Mac:</strong></p><ul><li>Mac OSX: 10.14 or above</li><li>Everything else is the same as above.</li></ul><p>Zbrush runs the same on Windows and Mac so there is no advantage over the other and the only real elements that you need to consider is your CPU and your RAM, A faster CPU with more cores will make this program run more stable and 16GB or RAM or more will also help with stability so if your running an older computer this will still work but you may be limited to pixel count but that is true for all 3D creation software.</p><h2 id="Autodesk-Maya"><a href="#Autodesk-Maya" class="headerlink" title="Autodesk Maya "></a>Autodesk Maya <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/autodesk-maya.jpg"                      alt="autodesk maya"                ></h2><p>This guide wouldn’t be complete without introducing Maya, Maya is another industry standard for modeling but also offers animation and rigging tools meaning this covers a lot more ground that some of the other 3D modeling software.</p><p>Maya is very powerful but for this guide I will only be talking about the 3D modeling creation tools as I feel other topics need their own space but that said I think it is important to mention this is a complete workflow from creation to the exportation of your movie file into Filmora ready for editing and uploading to your audience.</p><p>Again this software has a list of features that is simply too large to cover so i will highlight some useful features for your creative process.</p><ul><li>Polygon modeling lets you create 3D models based on vertexes, edges and faces.</li><li>Nurbs modeling lets you create 3d models from geometric primitives and drawn curves</li><li>Sculpting tools allows you to create organic sculpts</li><li>Subdivision workflow for better performance in higher pixel counts</li><li>Built in UV editing</li><li>Orthopedic viewport so you can check dimensions from whichever side you need</li></ul><p>Again we are only scratching the surface of what Maya can do. Maya is capable of creating hyper realistic hard surface and organic models for use within animation and also provides all the tools needed to get a perfect rendering. Again system performance is important to consider when choosing software and the minimum requirements are as follows:</p><ul><li>Windows 10 or 11, macOS x or above and linux but see website for compatibility.</li><li>64-bit Intel or AMD multi-core processor with SSE4.2, M series Mac under rosetta 2.</li><li>8GB of RAM but 16GB or more is recommended.</li><li>7GB free disk space for the install.</li><li>Three-button mouse.</li><li>Graphics card please see website for compatibility</li></ul><p>This is a paid software and can be expensive so please consider this when choosing your desired workflow but also consider that this is a complete workflow right up to importing your video file into Filmora so the price may be justified compared to multiple software. Another thing to consider is you can mostly get the desired results you want without the use of a drawing tablet cutting even more cost.</p><h2 id="3DCoat-2022"><a href="#3DCoat-2022" class="headerlink" title="3DCoat 2022 "></a>3DCoat 2022 <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/3-coat-2022.jpg"                      alt="3 coat 2022"                ></h2><p>3DCoat was first released in 2007 and has released constant updates inline with the 3D art community needs. Being a smaller team of developers it’s quite impressive what they have achieved as this is a fully featured 3D art software capable of creating very nice detailed models. When used with the likes of Daz 3D, Keyshot or similar animation software you can easily create the animation you are planning. This is not a full workflow but it is very close to one and the team are constantly releasing updates so one day it might be. You have the ability to UV your models as well as texture, paint and sculpt all within one program and this has one of the most impressive live retopo tools around called voxel modeling mode. Key features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Easy texturing and PBR with the use of smart materials and a HDRL viewport.</li><li>Voxel sculpting with complex boolean operations and adaptive dynamic tessellation.</li><li>Classic polygonal modeling is fully supported and also supports splines and joints.</li><li>Auto-retopology with user-defined edge loops but also fast and easy manual tools.</li><li>Professional tools for creating and editing UV-sets.</li><li>Native global uniform unwrapping algorithms.</li><li>PBR and HDRL rendering for concept exporting.</li><li>Use of scripts for repetitive actions.</li><li>And many more.</li></ul><p>This is paid software but with many options to buy as well as unlimited learning period which you will have to take into consideration when you are deciding to take this in your workflow. And again another consideration is your hardware and 3DCoat is complex due to the complexity of their software , as a point of reference there website states they consider a Surface Pro as the minimal hardware needed to use there software, minimum system specs are as follows:</p><ul><li>64-Bit Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10&#x2F;11, macOS 10.13 High Sierra or higher, Linux Ubuntu 20.04+</li><li>CPU m3 1.00 GHz,</li><li>4GB RAM</li><li>Intel HD Graphics 615</li><li>This will allow painting textures up to 2K and sculpting up to 1 million triangles</li></ul><p>What makes 3DCoat a good choice is the fact they have unlimited learning allowing you to journey into sculpting without putting any money in to start and in confection with other software it is very powerful.</p><h2 id="Blender"><a href="#Blender" class="headerlink" title="Blender "></a>Blender <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/blender-modeling-software.jpg"                      alt="blender modeling software"                ></h2><p>So now it’s time to talk about Blender, the Blender institute set off with one main goal in mind and that was to put powerful tools for use with 3D and CG in the hands of artists in the form of free&#x2F;open-source software. This is commendable and they have in large achieved what they set out to do, not only can you sculpt or model in Blender you can also rig and animate and add VFX to your projects.</p><p>It’s impressive to see what you can do with free software and you will be able to achieve very good results. What you miss out on in the form of automation tools and boutique brushes and toolsets this makes up for in an ever-expanding community driven tutorials and guides. With this being free it doesn’t make sense to not have this installed even if you have a different workflow due to the ability to expand with new skills that may work their way into your daily task. Key features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Render with impressive results thanks to cycles,</li><li>An extensive toolset for modeling, curves and retopology</li><li>Sculpting tools provide the power and flexibility needed in several stages of production</li><li>Designed for animation in mind</li><li>Push the boundaries of story art by drawing in a 3d environment</li><li>Powerful post FX and VFX tools like object motion tracking</li><li>Fully customisable UI and controles</li><li>Python API means every tool can be customized and scripted</li></ul><p>Blender is complex software and due to this some functions require different hardware specs but as a rule the higher the CPU speed and cores plus the more RAM you have the more you can do at any given time. With this said the minimum system requirements are as follows@</p><ul><li>Windows 8.1,10 and 11, macOS 10.13 and above and Linux supported</li><li>64-Bit quad core CPU with SSE2 support</li><li>8GB RAM</li><li>Full HD display</li><li>Mouse, trackpad or pen+tablet</li><li>Graphics card with 2GB VRAM, OpenGL 4.3 support</li></ul><p>Blender receives regular updates and is supported by community scripts and content and is becoming a new go to tool for 3D artists in all industries and backgrounds making it a real contender when picking a workflow.</p><p><strong>From Desktop to Portable</strong></p><p>There are lots of options and this list is in no way stating what you may already use is not good enough, this is just what is being used in the industry and is more accessible to a starter or someone who works from home and doesn’t want to spend thousands upfront for their software.</p><p>That being said there is more than just the desktop workflow and some people lead busy lifestyles and are always on the move. This is where I would like to introduce the portable workflow. Due to the fact the Ipad Pro is considered a must have for portable creativity and with recent releases there has never been a better time to start i will be showing Ipad compatible apps.</p><h2 id="Forger-by-Maxon"><a href="#Forger-by-Maxon" class="headerlink" title="Forger by Maxon "></a>Forger by Maxon <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/forger-by-maxon.jpg"                      alt="forger by maxon"                ></h2><p>Forger is released as a standalone app or part of the Maxon one. Forger gives you all the tools needed to create sculptures and models on the go which you can be proud of. Designed by artists for artists the features are quite large considering this is running on an ipad and with the seamlessness of importing and exporting to and from software such as cinema 4D this can be worked into your workflow very easily. One feature of Forger that people like to talk about is the ability to use your ipad camera and view your model in the real world using augmented reality.</p><p>Some of the key features of Forger but not limited to are as follows:</p><ul><li>Multi-resolution mesh sculpting via catmull0clark mesh subdivisions.</li><li>Volume-based quad-dominant remeshing.</li><li>Sculpt in layers.</li><li>Sculpt with a mask with the ability to clear, invert, blur, grow and shrink your masks.</li><li>Ability to close holes in existing meshes</li><li>Simple auto-generation of mesh UVs.</li><li>Symmetrical sculpting based on axis of choice</li><li>Ability to reapply symmetry to topologically symmetrical meshes.</li></ul><p>Forger is very powerful and don’t let the fact it’s on an ipad make you think it’s inferior to the bigger desktop software as this is very capable of getting the results you are looking for. It just takes a bit of researching and a different learning curve. Due to the fact it is on an ipad the system requirements are easier to achieve, minimum system requirements are as follows</p><ul><li>IOS 15 or later</li><li>Ipad pro or current model ipad</li></ul><p>A note from the developers, the more complex the model being sculpted, the more RAM required. While there is no screen size requirement, as anticipated the bigger the better when it comes to sculpting workspace.</p><h2 id="Nomad-Sculpt"><a href="#Nomad-Sculpt" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Sculpt "></a>Nomad Sculpt <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/nomad-sculpt-software.jpg"                      alt="nomad sculpt software"                ></h2><p>Nomad Sculpt is another contender offering powerful tools that artists can use to sculpt outstanding models for your animations. With a fixed price payment once you buy this you get regular updates and added features meaning you can buy with the confidence you will always have the best tools available. Nomad has a growing community of tutors giving guides and tutorials to get your desired results so no matter your experience Nomad is accessible to you. With the use of voxel remeshing and boolean you can experiment all you like and with the added history feature you can always undo and retrace your steps creating a non destructive workflow and piece of mind. Some of the key features of Nomad are as follows:</p><ul><li>Industry standard sculpting tools like clay, flatten, smooth, mask and cutting tools.</li><li>Stroke parameters can be customized with falloff, alphas and pencil pressure.</li><li>Vertex painting with color, roughness and metalness.</li><li>Work with layers for non destructive modeling.</li><li>Multiresolution sculpting for flexibility.</li><li>Voxel remeshing allows to quickly get uniform levels of detail.</li><li>Dynamic topology even with multiple layers.</li><li>PBR rendering by default with lighting and shadows and switchable matcaps</li><li>Post-processing , screen space reflection, depth of field, ambient occlusion and more</li><li>Customisable user interface</li></ul><p>Again due to being an app the system requirements are open to more users but unlike forger as of the writing of this Nomad is also available on Android giving people more options when choosing. System requirements are as follows:</p><ul><li>Iphone iOS 12.0 or later.</li><li>Ipad iPADOS 12.0 or later.</li><li>Ipod iOS 12.0 or later</li><li>Android 4.4 and up.</li></ul><h2 id="Procreate"><a href="#Procreate" class="headerlink" title="Procreate "></a>Procreate <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/procreate-3d-model.jpg"                      alt="procreate 3d model"                ></h2><p>Procreate gets an honorable mention here due to the recent update that added the ability to paint in 3D directly onto your imported OBJ’s. This is a very cool feature as you can paint on different maps directly onto your model and get the exact results you wanted, the prerequisite for this is your OBJ needs to have UV’s already applied when you import into procreate and also this is limited to only three maps as of writing this, they have started they are going to advancing this feature in upcoming updates.

But, if you want to have a better experience, you will need more. A research and test results reveal that Periscope requires 10.4 MB for viewing a 2 minutes video on an average that is equal to <strong>5.2MB</strong> per minute. So, for faster live streaming, the data requirement on Periscope remains the same.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Get-A-Faster-And-Better-Live-Streaming-Quality"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Get-A-Faster-And-Better-Live-Streaming-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Get A Faster And Better Live Streaming Quality"></a>Part 3: How To Get A Faster And Better Live Streaming Quality</h2><p> Here, I am sharing few tips in order to fine-tune your expertise in video creation on Periscope and take your video live streaming to the next level. To reach the heights in broadcasting, the following streaming habits are essential to follow. With the increase in online video streaming and people getting more and more hooked on the live videos, try to follow the points below for a faster live streaming experience for your audiences.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Delete-Cache-Files-On-Your-Phone"><a href="#Part-4-Delete-Cache-Files-On-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Delete Cache Files On Your Phone"></a>Part 4: Delete Cache Files On Your Phone</h2><p> The internet files and cache data covers a big space on your mobile phone. It weighs down your device making it heavy for any other videos to open. While closing a browser or a tab, the OS deletes thousands of small sized files that are automatically downloaded in order to open the web pages. When you do not close the browsers properly and shut down your device, the files stored automatically weighs down the browser, effecting faster live streaming and loading speed. Thus, prior to doing live streaming, open the browser settings and delete the recently used history and other provisional Internet files in order to increase live streaming speed.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Connect-WIFI-When-It-Is-Available"><a href="#Part-5-Connect-WIFI-When-It-Is-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Connect WIFI When It Is Available"></a>Part 5: Connect WIFI When It Is Available</h2><p> For any heavy file download or live streaming, mobile data usage can ruin your experience and it is also too much consuming, whether data or time. However, with WIFI, the live streaming becomes easy and seamless. Generally, if you check the speed, the WiFi is much faster than normal mobile data speed. So, it is always recommended to connect the wifi whenever and wherever available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/connect-wifi.JPG"                      alt="connect wifi"                ></p><h2 id="Part-6-Use-Third-Party-App"><a href="#Part-6-Use-Third-Party-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Use Third-Party App"></a>Part 6: Use Third-Party App</h2><p> If you want a faster live streaming on Periscope, the third-party apps like Speedify can be of great help to increase live streaming speed and improve live stream quality.

Many young people use YouTube to watch comedy shows, how-to videos, recipes, hacks, and music videos. Teenagers also use the video-sharing platform to subscribe to other YouTubers and famous personalities and to follow their favorite vloggers (video bloggers).</p><p>If you create your own personal YouTube channel and upload your videos, people can like, share, and comment on your videos. You can also comment and like others’ comments on your video. Unfortunately, you can’t see who’s liked or disliked your comments on YouTube, but you can see reactions to your posts.</p><p>If you are still wondering why you can’t see who liked or disliked a Youtube comment, you should know these things:</p><ul><li>Neither you nor anyone else on YouTube can see who liked or disliked your comment.</li><li>YouTube hides users’ likes and dislikes of comments for their protection and security.

Keep the conversation (and engagement) going by responding to comments.</p><p>Go to your YouTube Studio page and select Comments from the left-hand menu on YouTube. You can check comments you’ve set up to publish automatically without moderation by going to the Published tab.</p><p>They will be lingering on the Held for Review tab if comments need to be approved.

Many young people use YouTube to watch comedy shows, how-to videos, recipes, hacks, and music videos. Teenagers also use the video-sharing platform to subscribe to other YouTubers and famous personalities and to follow their favorite vloggers (video bloggers).</p><p>If you create your own personal YouTube channel and upload your videos, people can like, share, and comment on your videos.

This guide will show you how to use Microsoft Word, <strong>as well as 5 other online tools</strong>, to easily remove the background of any signature.</p><h2 id="Using-Microsoft-Word-as-a-Fast-Signature-Background-Remover"><a href="#Using-Microsoft-Word-as-a-Fast-Signature-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="Using Microsoft Word as a Fast Signature Background Remover"></a>Using Microsoft Word as a Fast Signature Background Remover</h2><p>Microsoft Word is one of the best options.

Just select the image and click on <strong>Crop</strong> from the upper-right corner of the screen.

You still haven’t acted because of a limited budget. Well, in this article, we will share 5 tips and tricks to help you film at home. So let’s dive into it.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Hack-DIY-A-Flag-for-Lighting-Control"><a href="#Part-1-Hack-DIY-A-Flag-for-Lighting-Control" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Hack. DIY A Flag for Lighting Control"></a>Part 1. Hack. DIY A Flag for Lighting Control</h2><p>When we set up the light near the subject, the light might be leaked onto the background. So, we may need to shape it to block the light from hitting the background.</p><p>On film sets and studios, the professionals use flags to absorb and make shapes of light. A flag is a thick black fabric that does not reflect light. To make your flag at home, you can try cardboard and a black t-shirt.</p><h3 id="1-A-Cardboard"><a href="#1-A-Cardboard" class="headerlink" title="1. A Cardboard"></a>1. A Cardboard</h3><p>You can buy it from a nearby stationery store. Ensure the cardboard is not too big to fit the t-shirt around the board.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-1.png"                      alt="cardboard used for diy flag"                ></p><h3 id="2-A-Black-T-shirt"><a href="#2-A-Black-T-shirt" class="headerlink" title="2. A Black T-shirt"></a>2. A Black T-shirt</h3><p>For the black t-shirt, you can use an old t-shirt that you don’t wear anymore. You can also find these shirts at your local thrift shop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-2.png"                      alt="black t-shirt for lighting control"                ></p><p>After managing all the required things, you must wrap and secure the t-shirt around the board. If the size of the t-shirt is larger than cardboard, tie the sleeves to secure the t-shirt. Or you can also use tape to secure the t-shirt and fasten it on the backside.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-3.png"                      alt="process for making diy flag"                ></p><p>With this DIY flag, you can now easily give shape and block the light while filming at home. <strong>Warnings:</strong> Some fabrics are not fireproof, so always keep an eye on the flag.</p><h3 id="Final-Results-for-the-Flag-Light-Shaping"><a href="#Final-Results-for-the-Flag-Light-Shaping" class="headerlink" title="Final Results for the Flag Light Shaping"></a>Final Results for the Flag Light Shaping</h3><p>After filming the video, see the precise results before using the flag, when the light is dispersed everywhere, which makes a euphoric effect. While after using the flag, the light is only glimpsing the subject.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-4.png"                      alt="results after using diy flag for lighting control"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Hack-DIY-Black-Wrap-or-Cinewrap"><a href="#Part-2-Hack-DIY-Black-Wrap-or-Cinewrap" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Hack. DIY Black Wrap or Cinewrap"></a>Part 2. Hack. DIY Black Wrap or Cinewrap</h2><p>The black wrap is used in professional studios and set up to block and shape light. You can block light by directly giving shape to LED lightbulbs. The black wrap is made mainly of aluminum, so it’s easy to provide forms for different lights.</p><p>The aluminum foils used in households have the same characteristics as a black wrap, so that you can use it as an alternative. Look at the following requirement to make it! To make a black wrap, you need two household tools. There is no need to get pricey things from the market. For this, follow the below outlines of the tools!</p><h3 id="1-A-Light-Bulb"><a href="#1-A-Light-Bulb" class="headerlink" title="1. A Light Bulb"></a>1. A Light Bulb</h3><p>You can take any LED bulb present at our home. Ensure that the bulb size is manageable to avoid any issues handling it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-5.png"                      alt="lightbulb used for cinewrap"                ></p><h3 id="2-Foil-Paper"><a href="#2-Foil-Paper" class="headerlink" title="2. Foil Paper"></a>2. Foil Paper</h3><p>The foil paper used to cover the lightbulb should be aluminum because foils usually absorb the light and get fired. In contrast, aluminum foil is resistant and doesn’t produce too much heat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-6.png"                      alt="foil paper used in the black wrap"                ></p><p>Now, all the tools are ready and waiting for further processing. For this, follow the processing step to make it work. To proceed further, you have to follow the below step-by-step process as shown:</p><p>Step1 First, carefully wrap the bulb with the foil paper to shape the light.</p><p>Step2 Then, you need to install the bulb on the lamp.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> During wrapping, you don’t have to allow the foil to touch the bottom part of the bulb.</p><p>Step3 Leave a small part of the bulb open from the top and cover the part from the side.</p><p>Step4 Ensure the lamp switch is off, and install the light bulb.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-7.png"                      alt="process of creating a black wrap"                ></p><p>When you turn on the lamp, the light has been shaped into a smaller light source.</p><h3 id="Final-Results-for-the-Black-Wrap-or-Cinewrap"><a href="#Final-Results-for-the-Black-Wrap-or-Cinewrap" class="headerlink" title="Final Results for the Black Wrap or Cinewrap"></a>Final Results for the Black Wrap or Cinewrap</h3><p>You can observe that the light is only at the required place, with no dispersion observed and no scattering. You can create more shapes to foil and then wrap them on the bulb for a different look.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-8.png"                      alt="results after using cinewrap"                ></p><p>After experimenting with light shaping and blocking hacks, we will move toward the light reflector hack!</p><h2 id="Part-3-Hack-DIY-Light-Reflector"><a href="#Part-3-Hack-DIY-Light-Reflector" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Hack. DIY Light Reflector"></a>Part 3. Hack. DIY Light Reflector</h2><p>A reflector is a spontaneous or specialized reflective surface that diverts the light to our subject or object. Professional filming setups usually use a large reflector to get a glowing effect on a subject or even more than two.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filming-diy-hacks-9.png"                      alt="light reflector used in a professional setup"                ></p><p>When applied to flat surfaces, the foil has a reflective surface. It makes it the best alternative to a professional reflector.

This is due to the launch of platforms like Twitch and Youtube, which have made it easier for content creators&#x2F;streamers to reach a wide audience. But how do these two platforms differ?</p><p>In this article, we’ll take a comprehensive look at <strong>Twitch vs. Youtube</strong> by comparing their browsing, content rule leniency, growth, and monetization. By the end, you’ll have a good understanding of which platform is right for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-vs-youtube.jpg"                      alt="twitch vs youtube"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube"></a>Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube</h2><p>Though Twitch and YouTube share some similarities, there are also some key differences between the two:</p><p><strong>Browsing:</strong> Twitch and YouTube are search engines, but they differ in how they recommend videos to viewers. Twitch focuses on more popular streamers and doesn’t let users edit their thumbnails, while YouTube makes it easier for newbies to be found with a customizable thumbnail feature.</p><p><strong>Content Rule Leniency:</strong> Twitch and YouTube’s content guidelines are slightly different. YouTube is more easygoing when it comes to what videos can be posted. On the other hand, Twitch has a reputation for banning streamers without any justification. Even streamers with contracts seem to be treated the same as anyone else when this happens.</p><p><strong>Growth:</strong> YouTube offers more advantages over Twitch in terms of growth as it is more accessible and has a better algorithm that allows small content creators to grow their channels quickly. However, Twitch mainly focuses on popular content streamers and offers fewer growth opportunities for newbies.</p><p><strong>Monetization:</strong> When it comes to monetization, both platforms offer different options for content creators. On Twitch, content creators can earn revenue from subscriptions, sponsored advertisements, donations, affiliate programs, merchandise sales, etc. On YouTube, content creators can earn revenue from direct advertisements, sponsorships, partnership programs, streams, donations, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-monetization.jpg"                      alt="youtube monetization"                ></p><p><strong>Chat and Moderation Policies:</strong> Twitch uses a time-based strict chat moderation policy and does not have the pause or rewind option. While on YouTube, the chat is arranged based on relevance and comes with only standard emojis for visual presentation.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming"><a href="#Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Comparison of Two Important Features Between Twitch and YOUTUBE: Partnership and Gaming</h2><h3 id="YouTube-vs-Twitch-Partnership"><a href="#YouTube-vs-Twitch-Partnership" class="headerlink" title="YouTube vs. Twitch Partnership"></a>YouTube vs. Twitch Partnership</h3><p>Affiliate programs are accessible on both Twitch and YouTube with specific requirements that you need to adhere to. These include a consistent uploading or streaming schedule, viewer engagement on your content, certain watch times, and the required number of subscribers on your channel.</p><p>Unlike YouTube, Twitch offers both affiliate and partnership programs.

Over the past few years, two of the biggest platforms for streaming gaming content have been Twitch and YouTube. So which platform is worth using? Let’s find out!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-gaming.jpg"                      alt="twitch gaming"                ></p><p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Twitch algorithm is mainly based on the number of viewers on your videos. Moreover, when browsing, it mainly suggests only the popular streamers with a strong subscriber base.</p><p>On the other hand, YouTube is owned by Google and creates more opportunities for streamers to be found. Also, its search algorithm takes into account the number of likes, comments, and shares on your video.</p><p><strong>Streamer-Viewer Dynamics:</strong> On Twitch, viewers often get more involved with the streamer as opposed to YouTube gaming viewers, who prefer to watch videos without commentary.</p><p><strong>Engagement Requirements For Streamers:</strong> To grow on YouTube, you need at least 4000 hours of watch time and a good number of likes, shares, and comments on your video. While on Twitch, you need at least a 20-30% engagement rate and a large number of subscribers.</p><p><strong>Competition Level Of Streamer:</strong> YouTube has fewer streamers but a 20 times more extensive user base. The potential for growth for new streamers is much higher due to the lower competition on the platform. Additionally, the platform provides more prominent exposure for new content creators.</p><h3 id="Verdict"><a href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h3><p>Twitch is a better streaming platform if you want to cultivate a following around your content. Although creating your followers’ community at first can be difficult, it largely depends on how engaging and compelling your content is.</p><p>As a new content creator or a streamer to create and upload pre-recorded videos, YouTube is a better choice for you. Make sure to upload the most enthralling games to keep your audience captivating and interested.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-Twitch-Or-YouTube-Pay-More"><a href="#Part-3-Does-Twitch-Or-YouTube-Pay-More" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Does Twitch Or YouTube Pay More?"></a>Part 3. Does Twitch Or YouTube Pay More?</h2><p>The amount of revenue you can make on Twitch or YouTube is directly related to your follower base. The higher the number of followers&#x2F;viewers, the more you will earn. Here’s how each platform pays its streamers.</p><h3 id="How-Twitch-Pay-Their-Streamers"><a href="#How-Twitch-Pay-Their-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="How Twitch Pay Their Streamers"></a>How Twitch Pay Their Streamers</h3><p>There are five ways in which you can make money while streaming your content on Twitch:</p><p><strong>Ads:</strong> You can turn on ads on your content when your stream gets the affiliate’s status. Ad revenues are based on the number of impressions (views) your content receives, and the average payout is $0.25 - $1.50 per 1,000 views.</p><p><strong>Bits</strong>: As a streamer on Twitch, you can also receive donations from your viewers in the form of a unique currency on the platform known as Bits. It’s important to note that Twitch takes a 29% cut-off of all donations made this way, leaving the streamer with 71% of the total donation. We have a complete guide to help you understand <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what Twitch Bits are and how to earn&#x2F;get them for free. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-bits.jpg"                      alt="twitch bits"                ></p><p><strong>Donations:</strong> Donations made through Paypal or other monetary exchange platforms benefit the streamer as they will receive 100% of the donation. This is the cheaper way of ensuring that the streamer gets the entire donation amount from the viewer.</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> Subscribers can support your channel by getting a subscription for a minimum of $4.99 per month. Twitch only takes 50% of subscription fees. This makes it much more profitable for streamers, as they can earn $2.50 per subscription per month.</p><p><strong>Merchandise:</strong> In terms of merchandise, Twitch has an advantage over YouTube because it comes with various merchandising extensions that can help you to make sales directly to your viewers during a live stream without the need for them to leave the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-monetization.jpg"                      alt="twitch monetization"                ></p><h3 id="How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers"><a href="#How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="How YouTube Pay Their Streamers"></a>How YouTube Pay Their Streamers</h3><p>YouTube pays its streamers in three different ways:</p><p><strong>Ads:</strong> Once your channel reaches a specific threshold, you become eligible for displaying ads on your YouTube channel. YouTube ads pay more than Twitch. For each 1000 ad views, you will get $18, which means you can earn up to $3 to $5 per 1k video views.</p><p><strong>Members:</strong> YouTube members are equivalent to Twitch’s subscribers. YouTube pays 70% of membership fees to the creators. The eligibility to offer channel memberships opens up at 30,000 subscribers for all types of channels, but for gaming channels, in particular, a minimum of 1,000 subscribers are required. Additionally, creators must also be a part of the YouTube Partner Program.</p><p><strong>Super Chat:</strong> Youtube pays streamers 70% of each super chat donation made on the platform and retains 30%. While this may seem to be expensive, it helps cover the costs of hosting a Livestream. Without this donation, Youtube would not be able to function as smoothly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-super-chat.jpg"                      alt="youtube super chat"                ></p><h3 id="Which-Pays-More"><a href="#Which-Pays-More" class="headerlink" title="Which Pays More?"></a>Which Pays More?</h3><p>Due to the lower threshold for monetization, Twitch pays more to the new content creators and offers more monetization options. However, it is difficult to grow on Twitch compared to YouTube, which has a stronger user base.</p><p>YouTube is easier to generate income in the long run as you can upload recorded gaming videos which can get more viewers as it is always available on the platform. Moreover, you can also make more from YouTube ads than on Twitch.</p><p><strong>Video - Where Should You Stream in 2022? - Twitch vs YouTube Live</strong></p><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h3 id="How-Much-Do-YouTube-Gaming-Streamers-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Do-YouTube-Gaming-Streamers-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Do YouTube Gaming Streamers Make?"></a>How Much Do YouTube Gaming Streamers Make?</h3><p>On YouTube, a streamer mainly gets paid based on the ads, which is $0.10 to $0.30 per ad view.

Make adjustments to the audio effect and tone directly.</li><li>Speech to Text&#x2F;Text to Speech- Use the Speech to Text function to transcribe the audio in the audio file into readable text for captions. Or, if you want to avoid using your own voice, you can use the TTS feature for AI-based narration based on the text you add.</li><li>Auto Synchronization- The software will automatically synchronize the audio with the video on the screen, scene-by-scene.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If you want a high-quality video with an adjusted or sped-up audio track or directly increase the tempo of your songs, use the mobile-based apps listed here. They come with varying features and simplified UI- choose your final option based on your requirements.</p><p>However, if you want to do more advanced editing work, you should use Filmora for sound editing and speed adjustment.
