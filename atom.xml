However, while these may work at first, twice, or even three times, they rarely produce long-term results.</p><p>Incorporating such <strong>storytelling in marketing</strong> captures attention, entices, and encourages potential customers — everything we need to close a sale. In addition, it encourages intimacy and trust — all of the additives for a fulfilling relationship.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-storytelling-in-marketing-sale-conversation.jpg"                      alt="best of storytelling in marketing sale conversation"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-Storytelling"><a href="#What-is-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="What is Storytelling?"></a>What is Storytelling?</h2><p>Storytelling is an ancient form of interactive personal expression that expresses the narrative while revealing many images and circumstances to the listener. Stories have always facilitated communication. A good story can also be told effectively using photos, images, and movies.</p><p>In line with this, storytelling also seeks to convey an idea by igniting the audience’s imagination through the storyteller’s words to create an image. Using storytelling, you may even write your own digital story. Therefore, inspiring stories serve as motivators and positively impact individuals’ behavior. The skill and influence of emotional storytelling can alter people’s attitudes, instill loyalty, and inspire them to perform specific actions.</p><h2 id="Why-is-Content-Marketing-so-Important"><a href="#Why-is-Content-Marketing-so-Important" class="headerlink" title="Why is Content Marketing so Important?"></a>Why is Content Marketing so Important?</h2><p>Content marketing improves the company’s online reputation. Viewers are served a variety of content in the form of blog entries, videos, infographics, presentations, and social media posts. By providing value, you draw in the audience while establishing brand trust.</p><p>Below are some reasons why successful content marketing storytelling can increase your company’s success.</p><p><strong>1. Develops a powerful brand personality</strong></p><p>Every brand has specific principles and traits that customers connect with, whether you attempt to or not. A brand personality relates to “who” a consumer is speaking with; as a result, a firm must be genuine, incorporate their worldviews, and explain why it matters in the context of their personal story. Storytelling marketing encourages your clients to feel a part of something bigger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/brand-personality-storytelling-marketing-digital.jpg"                      alt="brand personality in storytelling marketing digital"                ></p><p>The company’s story will be distinctive and interesting to the community if you take risky positions and emphasize your company principles. A memorable marketing narrative can make you stand out in a particular field, making you seem more like a friend than a faceless corporation.</p><p><strong>2. Builds an emotional connection and loyalty with customers</strong></p><p>People can identify with and interact with the finest tales because they feel something; as a result, they invest in the brand and what it advocates. The audience is likelier to like you and your business if they can relate to you or comprehend the steps that went into developing the brand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/content-marketing-storytelling-customer-connection.jpg"                      alt="customer connection in content marketing storytelling"                ></p><p>The ability to create emotions through the narrative is a significant weapon since it is kept in mind that people rarely make reasonable judgments. To effectively express your goal, transform it into an engaging story and employ a real storytelling and marketing approach.</p><p><strong>3. Generating new leads</strong></p><p>Lead generation is essential for small businesses because they depend on steady traffic to develop their brand and increase revenue. In addition to being excellent for generating leads, content marketing is also reasonably priced. If your business is working toward objective clients can support, you have a significantly higher chance of success.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/storytelling-and-marketing-generate-new-leads.jpg"                      alt="storytelling and marketing generates new leads"                ></p><p>People prefer to make purchases from organizations they perceive to be sympathetic. It’s simple to see content marketing storytelling’s importance when considering the return on investment. Emotional storytelling reveals your company’s empathy, which will most likely contribute to commercial success.</p><h2 id="How-to-Become-a-Good-Storyteller-for-Marketing"><a href="#How-to-Become-a-Good-Storyteller-for-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="How to Become a Good Storyteller for Marketing?"></a>How to Become a Good Storyteller for Marketing?</h2><p>A great storyteller can make a good narrative even more powerful. Therefore, skilled storytellers can captivate their audience, guide them in the right direction, and leave readers or listeners with new information to assimilate and a lesson they may keep for the rest of their existence.</p><p>The techniques listed below will help you become a better storyteller for marketing.</p><p><strong>1. Pick a compelling main point</strong></p><p>The main moral or message of a great story usually develops throughout. When writing a story, you must know what you are aiming to have. No matter what story you want to tell, it’s important to be certain about the central idea or conceit around which it is built.</p><p><strong>2. Have a clear plot structure</strong></p><p>The story’s narrative acts as its main direction. It ensures the story has a beginning, middle, and end and all the enjoyable material; thus, it creates a comfortable environment for your audience and lets people concentrate on other elements of your marketing narrative. A satisfying conclusion will also give your audience a sense of closure. Only if you are positioning yourself for the following chapter is it permissible to leave your character holding to the cliff’s brink.</p><p><strong>3. Show empathy</strong></p><p>Highly empathic individuals who focus on what other people think and feel are excellent storytellers. When telling stories, using empathy can assist you in choosing the most powerful terminology to describe a perspective that focuses on how you believe your use of language would affect an audience.</p><p><strong>4. Make it your own</strong></p><p>Consider providing a personal touch when delivering a narrative, whether it is to entertain or market a product. Your pitch will have the “genuine” factor with a personal touch. It is communicated through a testimonial. If you’re writing a story to entertain the audience, use your personal experiences to enrich the marketing narrative. This tip will give your story a more genuine sense.</p><p><strong>5. Feature appealing characters</strong></p><p>The character must be endearing if you desire your audience to root to see them succeed. Let your audience witness the development of emotions that your character experiences. Nothing is more depressing than a motionless character. Show them whoever your character is rather than telling them.</p><p><strong>6. Engage your audience</strong></p><p>A key component of effective visual storytelling marketing is engaging your audience, but how you do so largely relies on the type of storytelling marketing you’re doing. Consider your audience whenever you decide how to tell your narrative.</p><h2 id="How-can-Storytelling-in-Marketing-be-Presented-Finally"><a href="#How-can-Storytelling-in-Marketing-be-Presented-Finally" class="headerlink" title="How can Storytelling in Marketing be Presented Finally?"></a>How can Storytelling in Marketing be Presented Finally?</h2><p><strong>1. Text</strong></p><p>Written stories mostly consist of text, though they may also include pertinent imagery. Since this kind of story only needs paper and a pen or even some free writing software like Google Docs, it is also the most accessible and the simplest to write. A blog entry, an essay, and sometimes even a book are effective ways for a written story to reach its intended audience.</p><p>The best example of this type is the “socially aware, designer eyewear at revolutionary pricing” story from <a class="link"   href="https://www.warbyparker.com/history" >Warby Parker. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Instead of merely declaring things are cheap, they provide more context for the assertion by telling a story that explains why they are. He goes so far as to write stories explaining his beginnings on their cleaning cloths, adding a personalized experience and making it more efficient in storytelling and marketing.</p><p><strong>2. Audio</strong></p><p>These stories are very similar to textual stories, except that they are recorded. Technology breakthroughs have made it more accessible than ever to produce audio stories. Podcasts are typically used to tell such a marketing narrative. Great podcasters can blend emotional storytelling into their podcasts to make them entertaining and digestible while inspiring people to act.</p><p>This kind of podcast is exemplified by Camela Thompson from <a class="link"   href="https://calibermind.com/thought-leadership/podcasts/" >CaliberMind’s The Revenue Marketing Report. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Additionally, it is a podcast that primarily serves as a tool for education. On the show’s blogs, the features of each episode are presented, and on the website, you can arrange the episodes by genre.</p><p><strong>3. Photo</strong></p><p>A portion of photographic storytelling includes taking pictures of intriguing situations and events that are difficult to describe in words. These images either convey the tale of a fascinating person or people in an underappreciated setting or take on civil liberties or awareness aspects by highlighting the suffering of those living in impoverished or conflict-torn areas.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Javier-Arcenillas-5e418762e61ba-jpeg%5F%5F880.jpg" >“Latinoamerica,” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> a long-term piece by Javier Arcenilla, is an illustration of this kind. The photographer set out to capture the core of unchecked brutality in Latin America, the political and social forces that tenaciously support it, and the will to stop it. It is regarded as one of the best examples of how photography is used in storytelling in marketing.</p><p><strong>4. Video</strong></p><p>The best tools for collecting and sharing emotions are digital stories. Videos are used to narrate these stories. They cost the most to make, considering that they are the most advanced.</p><p>Fortunately, inexpensive video editing software may give your video story a polished, expert appearance without costing a fortune. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a fantastic video editor for creating content marketing storytelling because it has a handy timeline, the option to merge and edit audio and video recordings separately, powerful effects, and the opportunity to customize the interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong><em>Note: For further details, go to <a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/u2i39suoH5c" >Wondershare Filmora 11 | More Than Just You. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></strong></p><h2 id="Start-Your-Marketing-Storytelling-Tour"><a href="#Start-Your-Marketing-Storytelling-Tour" class="headerlink" title="Start Your Marketing Storytelling Tour"></a>Start Your Marketing Storytelling Tour</h2><p>Content marketing and storytelling go seamlessly together.

The resources utilized to express a story and convey a message include films, photography, animation, and music.

Development of Digital Storytelling"></a>Part II. Development of Digital Storytelling</h2><p>Dana Atchley and Joe Lambert of the Center for Digital Storytelling started the digital storytelling advancement in 1994 by teaching others how to create digital stories. Although the power of storytelling has existed for thousands of years, it has only recently become possible for storytellers to <strong>“become digital”</strong> because of the advancement of personal computers and friendly modern communications.</p><p>High goals and outdated technologies coexisted throughout this period. Browsers were quite straightforward at the time, and dial-up remained still in use. There were no devices for accessing the internet, and most individuals read the digital narrative on their desktop computers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/tools-and-tips-virtual-storytelling-2.jpg"                      alt="tools and tips for virtual storytelling"                ></p><p>In this regard, the Center for Digital Storytelling developed a digital story that emphasized first-person narratives that framed memories as potent stories using visuals, audio, and music.

Images, visual effects, and soundtracks are not merely additions to the story; they are crucial and inseparable components. As a result, digital storytelling demands variety, multisensory stimulation, and a variety of media channels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/online-modern-storytelling-view-3.jpg"                      alt="online view of modern storytelling"                ></p><p>While oral and written stories in traditional storytelling will only focus on listening and reading abilities, digital storytelling will emphasize other skills like interaction by encouraging knowledge acquisition and technology literacy by interacting with technological sources, thus possessing the power of storytelling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Visit <a href="https://youtu.be/eryg29f294U"><strong>Wondershare Filmora9: Discover the Power of Storytelling</strong></a> if you’re interested in learning how to create a digital storytelling video example.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Practices-of-Digital-Storytelling"><a href="#Part-III-Practices-of-Digital-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="Part III.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Converting-SDR-Video-to-HDR-A-Comprehensive-Tutorial"><a href="#Converting-SDR-Video-to-HDR-A-Comprehensive-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Converting SDR Video to HDR - A Comprehensive Tutorial"></a>Converting SDR Video to HDR - A Comprehensive Tutorial</h2><p><em>“I shot HDR video clips with the camera for my YouTube videos, but part of the footage is SDR, I hope to get a consistent video presentation, how could I do?”</em></p><p><em>So what do you do with all of your existing SDR content? To solve this, SDR to HDR conversion or vice versa can be one of the best solutions. So let’s take a further look at the available options to create amazing upconversions.</em></p><h2 id="Can-I-convert-the-SDR-video-to-HDR"><a href="#Can-I-convert-the-SDR-video-to-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Can I convert the SDR video to HDR?"></a>Can I convert the SDR video to HDR?</h2><p>Before diving into concrete steps, it’s best to have a decent understanding of how it works. Changing from SDR to HDR is possible, but with specific sequences, the results can vary accordingly. Of course, the video’s original quality would influence how it looks in the final outcome, even if you convert it into the high dynamic range or HDR version.</p><p>The camera noise and compression artifacts that are available in the video file will become more enhanced after the upconverting process. This means more clean-up work during and after the processing will become necessary. So, <strong>converting SDR to HDR</strong> successfully from the source file will not change entirely in some methods.</p><p>Given all that, does it even need to convert SDF video into HDR, you may ask. The answer is yes. Here are some reasons why:</p><ul><li><strong>Dark&#x2F;Light Balance</strong></li></ul><p>HDR content assures more light-and-dark balance in the videos&#x2F;images captured compared to the displayed version. The HDR video files have more defined highlights and shadows and noticeable luminance differences in scenes. So, the imagery is more realistic whether one clicks pictures outdoors or indoors, during the day or night.</p><ul><li><strong>3D Effect</strong></li></ul><p>Videos with a high dynamic range have enhanced depth perception. So, the surface objects are more noticeable, with perceptible shadows under the object against the background. Therefore, the files have a three-dimensional effect after you turn <strong>SDR to HDR.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A wide color gamut is available</strong></li></ul><p>HDR video comes with the availability of a wider color gamut that is not supported under SDR. With HDR, it is possible to expand the luminance and contrast levels, and color gradients are more prominent. To note, SDR monitors run with the Rec.709 colorspace spectrum, while HDR supports a wider Rec.2020 colorspace with more color variations.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Up-mapping-SDR-Archive-Content-to-HDR"><a href="#Method-1-Up-mapping-SDR-Archive-Content-to-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Up-mapping SDR Archive Content to HDR"></a>Method 1: Up-mapping SDR Archive Content to HDR</h3><p>It is possible to <strong>convert SDR to HDR</strong> after the legacy video-based content is mastered or recorded in SDR quality. Here, one can upconvert the content quality to HDR using the inverse tone mapping procedure. There are three content types that fall under the SDR Archive Content version:</p><ul><li><strong>SDR live-captured video content that comes with uncontrolled lighting</strong>. An example here includes Live Outdoor Sports shooting.</li><li><strong>SDR live-captured video content is available with controlled lighting</strong>. Examples include concerts, studio content recordings, and Indoor Sports shooting.</li><li><strong>Post-produced or mastered SDR content</strong>. These examples are documentaries and movies.</li></ul><p>Two sequences are available for upconverting SDR content from the archive to HDR. A suitable method would be to use the inverse tone-mapping functionality to set the HDR effect on the SDR content.</p><p>This process makes the SDR clips blend smoothly into the HDR content after you remaster them. You can use the real-time inverse tone-mapping tools and converters to make the SDR to HDR conversion.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Up-convert-SDR-clips-to-HDR-with-Video-editing-Software"><a href="#Method-2-Up-convert-SDR-clips-to-HDR-with-Video-editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Up-convert SDR clips to HDR with Video-editing Software"></a>Method 2: Up-convert SDR clips to HDR with Video-editing Software</h3><p>One of the best ways to convert SDR to HDR is to use video editing software. Not every editor supports SDR to HDR conversion, but <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does, especially with new upgrades since the v.11.5.4 version. Upgrades are visible under BorisFX effects, like the improved split mode function, Denoise effects, etc.</p><p>Additionally, it supports almost all kinds of formats, like MP4, M4V, MPG, VOB, HDR, and WMV. The gamut of tools allows easy customization and editing of the HDR video.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong>How to Use Filmora for SDR Video to HDR Conversion?</strong></p><p>Step1Install and open Filmora software on your PC or Mac.</p><p>Step2Press the “New Project” choice.</p><p>Step3Access “Click here to import media” &gt; Insert the SDR-quality video file in MPEG-1&#x2F;MPEG-2&#x2F;MPEG-4 or other video file formats.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-to-hdr-video-conversion-1.jpg"                      alt="insert sdr video file"                ></p><p>Step4Drag the video to the editing timeline below.</p><p>Step5Make edits like audio ducking, keyframing, chroma key background removal, adding filters, etc.</p><p>Step6Open Effects &gt; BorisFX &gt; Download.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-to-hdr-video-conversion-10.jpg"                      alt="open borisfx"                ></p><p>Step7Choose among the newer options like BCC Optical Diffusion, BCC Warp, and BCC Grads and Tints to upconvert to HDR quality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-to-hdr-video-conversion-11.jpg"                      alt="upconvert to hdr quality"                ></p><p>Step8Click on the Export button.</p><p>Step9Choose the Local tab and choose the video format for exporting.

These solutions do so when they save different content versions at varying resolutions and are compatible with broadcasting and server&#x2F;on-prem cloud systems.</p><p>When users use a video editing suite with MPEG2 decoding or encoding functions, they can store their SDR content while producing HDR videos.</p><p>This solution is useful for converting HDR-level video content into the legacy format, using on-demand or live pre-recorded material. While content providers are best for SDR to HDR conversion, you can expect better-quality control and monitoring work within the production environment.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Convert-SDR-to-HDR-through-a-Third-party-Encoding-Tool"><a href="#Method-4-Convert-SDR-to-HDR-through-a-Third-party-Encoding-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Convert SDR to HDR through a Third-party Encoding Tool"></a>Method 4: Convert SDR to HDR through a Third-party Encoding Tool</h3><p>Speaking of live encoding, you should try out the optimized tool for GUI transcoding, like <a class="link"   href="https://encodegui.com/" >EncodeGUI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This open-source and free video encoder works with AI integration to optimize overall video encoding and decoding functions. It is compatible with the NVIDIA GPU, which is suitable for HDR processing and conversion.</p><p>The software supports different formats suitable for SDR and HDR devices, like MKV, FLV, MP4, etc., and showcases a live encoding process preview. You can do further advanced encoding steps with AI-based filters, like DeNoise, Resolution Upscaling for <strong>SDR to HDR conversion</strong>, and Frame Interpolation.</p><p><strong>How to Use EncodeGUI to Convert SDR to HDR?</strong></p><p>Step1Download and install EncodeGUI v.1.0.5.

This can be done by clicking File &gt; Import Media or click Import New Files on the left panel. Ideally you need to keep all your photos in a single folder and name them according to sequence. This would instantly pick up the image sequence when you click on the first file. Then the software will create a reference video automatically, which may take a couple of seconds.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn How to shoot a time-lapse video with GoPro Hero5 Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-gopro-studio.jpg"                      alt="GoPro Studio Import"                ></p><h4 id="2-Select-the-Clips"><a href="#2-Select-the-Clips" class="headerlink" title="2. Select the Clips"></a><strong>2. Select the Clips</strong></h4><p>The reference video would be imported by GoPro Studio. Go to Import New Files and click the video to add it to the central window. When you click the Play button, you can watch the time-lapse played at approximately 30 fps. In the left hand corner of the bottom you can see the Advanced Setting button. By adjusting these settings you will be able to select your desired frame rate. There are also other options like Quality setting, Motion Blur and the Speedup option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/advanced-settings-gopro-studio.jpg"                      alt="GoPro Studio Advanced Settings"                ></p><h4 id="3-Convert"><a href="#3-Convert" class="headerlink" title="3. Convert"></a><strong>3. Convert</strong></h4><p>The clip is automatically queued at the conversion list. While adding more than one clip just repeat the process to add them to your conversion list panel. Now you just need to click the convert button, and all the sequences would be converted into a ready-to-edit video file. It might take some time depending on how many clips you have. You will see a preview in a tiny thumbnail while it’s processing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-4.jpg"                      alt="GoPro Studio Conversion"                ></p><h4 id="4-Edit"><a href="#4-Edit" class="headerlink" title="4. Edit"></a><strong>4. Edit</strong></h4><p>Once the conversion is done, you need to click on Proceed to Next Stage which would take you to the edit panel. Now drag the videos from the media window and place them on the timeline just under the centre window. The video can be edited here and the speed can be altered in the right hand window by unfolding the video and dragging the speed slider. The framing can also be altered so that you can select how much of the image you want to show.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-interface-gopro-studio.jpg"                      alt="GoPro Studio Edit Interface"                ></p><h4 id="5-Export"><a href="#5-Export" class="headerlink" title="5.

If the basic settings don’t bother you, then just click the Export button. A new browser window would open, where you can name the file to be exported and select the location where you want to save. You can even select the setting at which you want it exported. You will find optimized settings for Vimeo and YouTube, and you can even do the setting individually by going to the Custom option.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn more in Complete Guide to Edit a Video with GoPro Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Create-GoPro-timelapse-video-from-Video-Clips"><a href="#Create-GoPro-timelapse-video-from-Video-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Create GoPro timelapse video from Video Clips"></a>Create GoPro timelapse video from Video Clips</h2><p>You can also choose to make a time-lapse video with the help of the video clips shot on your action camera.</p><p>After importing and converting your videos, go to the Edit section and drag the speed slider under the Video menu on the right hand panel. Generally 100% is the normal speed but you can always increase the number for a higher speed.</p><p>However, importing your video clips to GoPro Studio is a rather time taking process which is going to test your patience. So, we recommend you the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> software. With Filmora, you will be able to import a video as large as 8GB in just 2 minutes, and the trim and merge feature would allow you to use certain specific frames without any loss in quality. The Filmora editing software would also allow you to speed up the video clips, so that you can speed up the trimmed no quality loss clips to make a wonderful time lapse video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/speed-effect-speed-add-marker.png"                      alt="Speed up interface"                ></p><p>Check this video to know more about what can Filmora do with your GoPro footages</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><h5 id="Max-Wales-1"><a href="#Max-Wales-1" class="headerlink" title="Max Wales"></a>Max Wales</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Time-lapse can be defined as a technique through which the photos are shot at a certain time interval and then played back at a faster speed which results in a lapse of time.

It is a sequence of photos stitched together to create a movie or video where time seems to pass extremely fast. For instance, wilting and blooming for the flow only in a 10-second video. You might have seen numerous <strong>Canon time-lapse</strong>s and always wanted to create one.</p><p>If you want to take the challenge and create something magical like this with your Canon camera, you have come to the right place. Here we will tell you everything from how to shoot to editing time-lapse videos. You will also get some tips for time-lapse recording video so let’s start with this article.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Time-lapse-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Time-lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Time-lapse Video?"></a>Part 1. What is Time-lapse Video?</h2><p>Time-lapse video is considered a technique of cinematography where a photographer takes a series of images in the same frame at several intervals for a certain period and rapidly plays it for the entire time. For instance:- Separate shots of a flower blooming over time becomes a video of growing a flower from seedling to bloom.</p><p>So what’s the purpose of it? Here is the purpose of creating an illusion of extreme speed movement by manipulating the time. It seems like the object is rushing at a fast pace. This cinematography technique is mainly used for capturing prolonged processes that will become exciting and visible if it is watched with the human eye.</p><p>The time-lapse is even used to capture swift movement, showing it faster. This article will explore how time-lapse on canon 6d is made. In simple words, time-lapse is a process of shooting for an extended period and then editing in fast motion to make it enjoyable. Let’s see how it is done.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-Canon-Camera"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-Canon-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with Canon Camera?"></a>Part 2. How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with Canon Camera?</h2><p>Let’s explore the time-lapse world in the comfort of your home or when you are chilling out with your family and friends. You can use your Canon 70d time-lapse to do it better. The time-lapse is an innovative technique that allows you to reveal a hidden world on the move, and it will produce some magical and surprising results. Let’s check out the steps of hooting time-lapse video with a Canon camera.</p><p><strong>1:-</strong> Change your Canon camera settings to the Time-lapse movie by tapping on the menu and searching Timelapse Movie mode in your menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-time-lapse-canon-camera.jpg"                      alt="enable time lapse on canon"                ></p><p><strong>2:-</strong> Tap on the info button to access the setting for the interval time and the no. of shots.</p><p><strong>3:-</strong> You can choose the interval number to determine your camera’s frequency, which means once every second or twice a minute. The interval time will depend on the subject. Recording a slow-moving object like blossoming flowers or drifting clouds will take more time between the shots and vice versa.</p><p><strong>4:-</strong> Put the number of shots you want your camera to take. According to the interval and number of shots, your Canon 80d time-lapse will tell you the number of footage you have to take to end the video. There is a general thumb rule for recording time-lapse videos, and you will need around 24-25 images for each second of your video.</p><p><strong>5:-</strong> Compose the shot and tap on the shutter button. While shooting the time-lapse video, it is recommended that you should place the camera on a tripod to maintain the composition of duration. Also, after you are happy with the composition and settings, you can tap the shutter button and allow your camera to show its magic.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips"><a href="#Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Canon Time Lapse Video Shooting Tips"></a>Part 3. Canon Time Lapse Video Shooting Tips</h2><p><strong>Never forget to take test shots:-</strong> You must never start shooting straight away. Also, you can take some random test shots. This ensures you get the best composition and angle you are looking for.</p><p><strong>Always take photos in JPG:-</strong> Set the Canon Camera to capture pictures in the best JPG quality, or else you can run out of space quickly.</p><p><strong>Use manual mode:-</strong> It’s recommended to shoot in manual mode, and you must shoot with the manual white balance, exposure, aperture, and shutter speed. Moreover, it will help you to avoid auto-adjusting your camera.</p><p><strong>Carry extra batteries:-</strong> If you want to create a time-lapse video outdoors, you must carry extra batteries. Also, it is good if the camera battery is changed before your camera gets shut down. If you are shooting time-lapse video indoors, it’s better to use the main charger. Also, it will help you avoid excess battery draining.</p><p><strong>Carry Extra Memory cards:-</strong> You will never want to run out of space while making a time-lapse, and you will have to make the calculations according to your time-lapse. Also, make sure you carry the extra memory cards to be prepared.</p><p><strong>Choose the best spot:-</strong> Set your tripod securely and in a place where it cannot be knocked or moved quickly.</p><p><strong>Focus on the camera:-</strong> Always ensure that the equipment and camera are in sight while you are shooting and safe.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Extra-How-to-Edit-Timelapse-Video-on-Computer"><a href="#Part-4-Extra-How-to-Edit-Timelapse-Video-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

It indicates that it doesn’t matter for how long what you value has been around. And photography is no exception. It has been around for ages, with its physical image being the most valued aspect. Photo-montage is one mode of representing reality in the form of photographs.</p><p>It has come a long way from printed form and is now scalability in the digital space. Currently, photomontage-making tools are available for quick mounting. But you also need perfection in this noble act, which is why tips and tricks before making a photo mount are ideal. Let’s dive in below for more emphasis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-a-photo-montage-1.jpg"                      alt="how to make a photo montage"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-a-photomontage"><a href="#What-is-a-photomontage" class="headerlink" title="What is a photomontage?"></a>What is a photomontage?</h2><p>Unlike the typical photograph with a single pic, a photomontage encompasses several photos collaged together. It doesn’t matter the number of photos it contains. You can also use a variety of locations to take photos. Way back, photographers composed photo montage images by cutting, gluing, and arranging pieces together. However, the advent of computers has shifted the dimension of making a photo montage. Several apps are available for not only montaging your photos, but also editing them for a splendid outcome.</p><h2 id="Things-to-pay-attention-to-before-making-a-PhotoMontage"><a href="#Things-to-pay-attention-to-before-making-a-PhotoMontage" class="headerlink" title="Things to pay attention to before making a PhotoMontage"></a>Things to pay attention to before making a PhotoMontage</h2><p>Let’s check out what to consider in the quest to make a photo montage.</p><h3 id="i-What’s-your-subject"><a href="#i-What’s-your-subject" class="headerlink" title="i) What’s your subject?"></a>i) What’s your subject?</h3><p>Ask yourself what you intend to express with your photomontage. Pick a subject that’s static and simple. You should also consider the ease of adding more photos if you need to. Plan out how many photos you want to include in your montage as well.</p><h3 id="ii-Keep-it-real"><a href="#ii-Keep-it-real" class="headerlink" title="ii) Keep it real"></a>ii) Keep it real</h3><p>Don’t exaggerate your work, but keep it real. At a glance, related collage photos will make sense. Likewise, check the photos you are importing into your editing program. It’s great to use easily editable clips.</p><h3 id="iii-Be-adventurous"><a href="#iii-Be-adventurous" class="headerlink" title="iii) Be adventurous"></a>iii) Be adventurous</h3><p>Making a photomontage need not be plain. Go out of your way and add some creativity as well. Have in mind what you want to create in advance to avoid distractions. However, add all the necessary elements and just let it be fun.</p><h3 id="iv-Take-more-than-needed"><a href="#iv-Take-more-than-needed" class="headerlink" title="iv) Take more than needed"></a>iv) Take more than needed</h3><p>Have more backup photos than you need. This gives you ways to twist your arrangement where necessary. It is also a perfect way to try several suits and find the right match for your college.</p><h3 id="v-Resize-your-photos"><a href="#v-Resize-your-photos" class="headerlink" title="v) Resize your photos"></a>v) Resize your photos</h3><p>Photos of different sizes would do better than using the same size. So, be ready to resize some clips to make a perfect fit in each corner.</p><h3 id="vi-Get-a-quality-photomontage-tool"><a href="#vi-Get-a-quality-photomontage-tool" class="headerlink" title="vi) Get a quality photomontage tool"></a>vi) Get a quality photomontage tool</h3><p>The choice of a tool is also paramount.

Use Long Exposures"></a>1.  Use Long Exposures</h4><p> The exposure is the amount of time the camera’s sensor is exposed to light. If you are taking a photo in broad daylight exposure value is going to 1&#x2F;800 of a second or even less, while if you find yourself in a situation where light is scarce the exposure value should be anywhere between 3 to 30 seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/long-exposure-iphone.jpg"                      alt="long-exposure-iphone"                ></p><p> Image resource: iOS Gadget Hacks</p><p> In low light scenes, the long exposure will help your camera gather more light. However, long exposures can produce grainy photos.</p><h4 id="2-Make-Sure-that-Your-iPhone-is-Perfectly-Still"><a href="#2-Make-Sure-that-Your-iPhone-is-Perfectly-Still" class="headerlink" title="2.  Make Sure that Your iPhone is Perfectly Still"></a>2.  Make Sure that Your iPhone is Perfectly Still</h4><p> Any camera shake that occurs while the camera shutter is open will result in blurry photos. The exposure value you set determines how long the shutter is going to be open.</p><p> Holding a camera still for a long period of time is impossible, which is the reason why you should get a tripod if you want to take sharp night photos. Finding other ways to keep your iPhone steady, such as placing it on a firm, flat surface is also an option.</p><h4 id="3-Experiment-with-Ambient-Light-and-Shadows"><a href="#3-Experiment-with-Ambient-Light-and-Shadows" class="headerlink" title="3.  Experiment with Ambient Light and Shadows"></a>3.  Experiment with Ambient Light and Shadows</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/golden-hour-photo.jpg"                      alt="golden-hour-photo"                ></p><p> Image resource: Contrastly</p><p> A good photographer always comes up with ways to work with what they’ve got, so instead of trying to avoid shadows and ambient lights, embrace them and make them a part of your photo. By doing so, you’ll be able to contribute to an overall impression of realism in a photo, and at the same time, you’ll create photos that have strong contrasts.</p><h4 id="4-Find-Creative-Ways-to-Make-Good-Use-of-Backlighting"><a href="#4-Find-Creative-Ways-to-Make-Good-Use-of-Backlighting" class="headerlink" title="4.  Find Creative Ways to Make Good Use of Backlighting"></a>4.  Find Creative Ways to Make Good Use of Backlighting</h4><p> Taking photos by night means that you’re going to have a source of light in your shot. Backlight or a source of light in the background of your photo will enable you to get creative and capture people or objects in front of window shops, street lights or any other light source you can fathom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/backlight-photography.jpg"                      alt="backlight-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: Coles Classroom</p><h4 id="5-Utilize-Different-Sources-of-Light-to-Illuminate-the-Subject-of-a-Photo"><a href="#5-Utilize-Different-Sources-of-Light-to-Illuminate-the-Subject-of-a-Photo" class="headerlink" title="5.  Utilize Different Sources of Light to Illuminate the Subject of a Photo"></a>5.  Utilize Different Sources of Light to Illuminate the Subject of a Photo</h4><p> The cities offer countless artificial sources of light during the night, so coming up with creative ways to incorporate these light sources into your night photos is a part of the creative challenge of night photography. Place the subject of your photo into a well-lit area, and try to surround it with a dark negative space in order to create a high contrast photo.</p><h4 id="6-Convert-Your-Night-Photos-to-Black-and-White"><a href="#6-Convert-Your-Night-Photos-to-Black-and-White" class="headerlink" title="6.  Convert Your Night Photos to Black and White"></a>6.

Use Long Exposures"></a>1.  Use Long Exposures</h4><p> The exposure is the amount of time the camera’s sensor is exposed to light. If you are taking a photo in broad daylight exposure value is going to 1&#x2F;800 of a second or even less, while if you find yourself in a situation where light is scarce the exposure value should be anywhere between 3 to 30 seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/long-exposure-iphone.jpg"                      alt="long-exposure-iphone"                ></p><p> Image resource: iOS Gadget Hacks</p><p> In low light scenes, the long exposure will help your camera gather more light.

Make Sure that Your iPhone is Perfectly Still</h4><p> Any camera shake that occurs while the camera shutter is open will result in blurry photos. The exposure value you set determines how long the shutter is going to be open.</p><p> Holding a camera still for a long period of time is impossible, which is the reason why you should get a tripod if you want to take sharp night photos. Finding other ways to keep your iPhone steady, such as placing it on a firm, flat surface is also an option.</p><h4 id="3-Experiment-with-Ambient-Light-and-Shadows-3"><a href="#3-Experiment-with-Ambient-Light-and-Shadows-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Conquer-Job-Interviews-with-Confidence-Excellence"><a href="#Conquer-Job-Interviews-with-Confidence-Excellence" class="headerlink" title="Conquer Job Interviews with Confidence &amp; Excellence"></a>Conquer Job Interviews with Confidence &amp; Excellence</h2><p>Creating a YouTube channel might be advantageous even if you have no intention of becoming a professional YouTuber. It’s a great opportunity to meet others who share your interests and form a community, and you can learn a lot of useful skills, like how to talk more confidently.</p><p>However, it might be difficult to distinguish out when there are so many talented channels in every imaginable field. Making a strong introduction for your films is one of the finest methods to capture the interest of your audience. What therefore ought to your YouTube intros contain? Discover all the crucial details by continuing to read this article.</p><h2 id="1-Keep-your-intro-brief"><a href="#1-Keep-your-intro-brief" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep your intro brief"></a>1. Keep your intro brief</h2><p>The average human attention span has decreased over time. You risk losing viewers if you prolong the beginning of your YouTube video beyond what is essential given the abundance of free materials available today.</p><p>Make sure that your introduction lasts no more than 10 seconds as a general rule of thumb. The shorter the better if you can manage it. Remember, you don’t have to give away everything in your film. You only need to give them enough of a reason to continue watching.</p><h2 id="2-Stay-in-the-theme"><a href="#2-Stay-in-the-theme" class="headerlink" title="2. Stay in the theme"></a>2. Stay in the theme</h2><p>While few rule-breakers have found success, the majority of well-liked YouTube channels have a distinct niche that attracts viewers and followers. Without it, you won’t be able to draw in and satisfy your target market.</p><p>Your opening should be consistent with your theme and branding across the entire YouTube channel. When you know the answers to those questions, you’ll be more equipped to create an interesting YouTube channel introduction.</p><h2 id="3-Make-the-first-7-seconds-count"><a href="#3-Make-the-first-7-seconds-count" class="headerlink" title="3. Make the first 7 seconds count"></a>3. Make the first 7 seconds count</h2><p>Although branding is important, it won’t guarantee views and subscribers for your YouTube intro. Your efforts will be in vain if you don’t provide your viewers a compelling incentive to stick around.</p><p>Making a great first impression is a must when planning the opening sequence for your YouTube channel. Try to highlight the value the audience will receive from viewing your films; a brief tagline that sums up your core principles is a good starting point.</p><p>Above all else, being genuine will help you make a good first impression. Others will see right through you and move on if you try to force a personality that isn’t yours or if it’s obvious that you’re not interested in the subjects you raise.</p><h2 id="4-Make-a-plan"><a href="#4-Make-a-plan" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a plan"></a>4. Make a plan</h2><p>The quantity of tasks you have to complete before your YouTube channel takes off is one of the most difficult aspects of launching one. If you don’t divide them up into manageable portions, you’ll probably start to feel overwhelmed very quickly.</p><p>One of the best things you can do is plan ahead when making an introduction for your YouTube channel. Making two or three prototypes and putting them through testing to discover which works best could also be helpful.</p><p>It’s important to keep in mind that while you should have a plan, you don’t necessarily need a very detailed one at this time. Have enough to launch you and allow you to make adjustments as you gain velocity.</p><h2 id="5-Include-a-Call-To-Action"><a href="#5-Include-a-Call-To-Action" class="headerlink" title="5. Include a Call-To-Action"></a>5. Include a Call-To-Action</h2><p>Now is the time to deal with any concerns you may have with asking people for things. You won’t get as a content creator if you don’t ask, and this also applies to YouTube.</p><p>After you’ve written your introduction, you might want to think about inserting a call to action (CTA). Users will be prompted to take the action you want them to, such as follow you on social media or subscribe to your channel, if you do this.</p><p>Your CTA needs to be brief and concise. If you make it sound too airy, your audience will miss the point and you’ll come out as uncertain of your goal.</p><h2 id="6-Keep-it-simple"><a href="#6-Keep-it-simple" class="headerlink" title="6. Keep it simple"></a>6. Keep it simple</h2><p>It’s simple to assume that more is better when creating a YouTube channel. However, if you’re just starting out, the opposite is typically true.</p><p>Make a thorough inventory of everything you could include before putting together your YouTube intro. After you’ve written down everything you can think of, pick down the one or two most crucial elements.</p><p>You’ll save a lot of time by making your YouTube intro simpler. Additionally, it will make your channel feel more cohesive.</p><h2 id="7-Create-a-stunning-intro"><a href="#7-Create-a-stunning-intro" class="headerlink" title="7. Create a stunning intro"></a>7. Create a stunning intro</h2><p>For the majority of producers, creating a successful YouTube channel takes years of trial and error. A perfectionist attitude will hold you back in the beginning, especially when it comes to your introduction.</p><p>Make a YouTube opening that’s decent enough to get you started rather than aiming to create something ideal. You can adjust as needed as your talents advance and your understanding of the path you want to go in deepens.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p></article[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)For macOS 10.14 or later<p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/the-most-reliable-zero-price-online-photo-editors-guide/"><u>The Most Reliable Zero-Price Online Photo Editors Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-best-action-cameras-unlocked-your-2023-snorkeling-guide/"><u>[Updated] Best Action Cameras Unlocked - Your 2023 Snorkeling Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/in-2024-cost-effective-action-cams-unveiled/"><u>In 2024, Cost-Effective Action Cams Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/industrys-mightiest-drone-fleet-compilation/"><u>Industry's Mightiest Drone Fleet Compilation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/free-online-10-the-best-subtitles-tools/"><u>Free Online 10  The Best Subtitles Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/complete-action-camera-buying-guide-for-beginners-2023-update-for-2024/"><u>Complete Action Camera Buying Guide For Beginners -2023 Update for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/beyond-imagination-vr-powered-movies-for-2024/"><u>Beyond Imagination  VR-Powered Movies for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/vivavideo-review-the-users-perspective/"><u>VivaVideo Review  The User's Perspective</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-budget-no-more-top-5-free-visual-effect-sites/"><u>2024 Approved  Budget No More!

Even after several years since this feature has been available on the iPad, Apple just added the feature to iPhones with the launch of iOS 14. This feature is a nice creation as it helps users perform numerous tasks and not only focus on one event.</p><p>Thanks to this invention, users can reply to customers’ emails while closing a new lead on Facetime. This article will teach you how to enable and disable the picture in picture mode in Safari on Mac, iPhone, and iPad. Stick with us!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-in-safari-for-mac-iphone-ipad-1.jpg"                      alt="reply emails"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-Mac"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

How to enable and disable picture in picture in Safari for Mac</h2><p>Picture-in-Picture PiP mode is a feature that allows you to view movies in a tiny floating window while surfing another website in Safari or doing something else on your Mac. It remains in the foreground of your screen regardless of which new program you start on your PC.</p><p>To experience Picture in Picture on Mac, you must first launch Safari. You may use Safari’s PiP mode on any video content website. Other browsers do not currently support this functionality.</p><p>Another consideration is that some websites may not support Picture in Picture. In this situation, you will be unable to watch your chosen videos unless you use particular programs that support them. However, because each site operates differently, the procedure you must use to enter this mode may differ.</p><h3 id="Entry-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-on-Mac"><a href="#Entry-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Entry Picture in Picture (PiP) on Mac"></a>Entry Picture in Picture (PiP) on Mac</h3><p>Let’s have a look at how to use Picture in Picture in Safari on Mac:</p><ul><li>After you start Safari, you may go to any website you choose.</li><li>Find the videos you wish to view and press the play button.</li><li>Once it starts playing, you will notice a <strong>small sound icon</strong> at the top tab; you can <strong>right-click or hold control</strong> while clicking on this icon.</li><li>You will notice a drop-down where you can select the <strong>“Enter Picture in Picture.”</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-in-safari-for-mac-iphone-ipad-2.jpg"                      alt="enter picture in picture"                ></p><ul><li>Suppose you opened the video tab only; you will see the small sound icon in the address bar. But if you open other tabs, in that case, you will see the small sound icon on the right side of the tab.</li></ul><p>You can see that utilizing Picture in Picture in Safari for Mac is simple, straightforward, and adaptable. Let’s look at how to get the most of this feature now.</p><h3 id="Using-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-on-Mac"><a href="#Using-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Using Picture in Picture (PiP) on Mac"></a>Using Picture in Picture (PiP) on Mac</h3><p>When you enable this feature, the video will shrink and move to a corner on Mac’s screen while still playing. You can perform several tasks to your taste as you keep watching and working. If you feel the size is too small or big, you can resize it by dragging any corner of the video. Furthermore, you can click and pull it to any side of the window if it disturbs your view.</p><p>There is a play and pause button available also as well as the forward and backward if you wish to perform any of these activities. And again, you can decide to turn off this feature by repeating the procedure where you locate the small sound icon. But here, you select the mute this tab instead or click the “<strong>X”</strong> button at the top left corner to stop the video.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to enable and disable picture in picture in Safari for iPhone"></a>Part 2. How to enable and disable picture in picture in Safari for iPhone</h2><p>As we have discussed earlier, users have a way to enable the picture in picture mode before launching iOS14, where the feature is incorporated in the settings. Thanks to Apple’s new APIs, this functionality is no longer limited to watching videos while working on other apps with iOS 15. However, the following procedure is how you can enable the picture in picture mode on your iPhone.</p><ul><li>Go to your iPhone’s <strong>“Settings”</strong> and scroll to the <strong>General</strong></li><li>Search for <strong>Picture in Picture</strong> in the <strong>General</strong> section and click on the option.</li><li>Once it opens, you will see a toggle button for <strong>Start PiP Automatically</strong>; turn it <strong>ON</strong> to enable it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-in-safari-for-mac-iphone-ipad-3.jpg"                      alt="start pip automatically"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You perform the above procedure also to disable the feature. However, in the case of disabling the option, you turn <strong>OFF</strong> the toggle button for <strong>Start PiP Automatically</strong> to disable this function.</p><h3 id="Using-the-Picture-in-Picture-feature-on-iPhones"><a href="#Using-the-Picture-in-Picture-feature-on-iPhones" class="headerlink" title="Using the Picture in Picture feature on iPhones"></a>Using the Picture in Picture feature on iPhones</h3><p>Once you lunch this feature on iOS 14 or greater versions, it automatically shrinks to the top or bottom side of the screen. Here, you can perform several activities with the features, including resizing, moving, and aligning the video with the window. In the case of aligning, depending on your choice, it could be to the screen’s top right, bottom right, top left, and bottom left.</p><p>To move the window to any screen part, simply tap and hold the video to drag and place it on any part of the screen you want. Another fantastic feature the iPhone offers is that it allows you to minimize the picture-in-picture window, and you will keep listening to the audio part of the video while working on other apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-in-safari-for-mac-iphone-ipad-4.jpg"                      alt="move the window to any screen part"                ></p><p>To perform this minimizing feature, grab the window and move it to either side of the screen’s edge. In doing so, the window will disappear, and you will keep hearing the sound only. But, on the screen side, where you move the window, you will see an arrow and a grabber indicating its presence, and you can use it to revive the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-in-safari-for-mac-iphone-ipad-5.jpg"                      alt="move the window to screen&#39;s edge"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-iPad"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to enable and disable picture in picture in Safari for iPad"></a>Part 3. How to enable and disable picture in picture in Safari for iPad</h2><p>The picture in picture mode has been available on the iPad long before it was incorporated into other Apple products. However, enabling it on the iPad is one of the easiest things to do. Furthermore, disabling this feature follows the procedure you followed when enabling it. Following the procedures highlighted below will help you enable and disable PiP on your iPad:</p><ul><li>On your iPad, go to <strong>“Settings”</strong>.</li><li>Locate the <strong>“General”</strong></li><li>Scroll to the <strong>“Multitasking and Dock”</strong>.</li><li>Here, toggle picture in picture ON to enable this feature; otherwise, toggle picture in picture OFF to disable the feature.</li></ul><p>Above all, you need to have it in the back of your mind that regardless of how you enable this feature, the app or website needs to support the picture in picture mode to work correctly. However, almost all website supports this feature, with YouTube being the top supporter.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Going through emails in the morning while viewing news videos in Picture-in-Picture mode can help you save time. You don’t have to launch a new Safari window or rely on Split View, which consumes important screen space while multitasking.</p><p>Aside from Safari, the Picture-in-Picture mode is available in other standard programs like QuickTime and Apple TV. You can even utilize PiP mode on your iPhone if it’s running iOS 14 or later.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="Using-the-Picture-in-Picture-feature-on-iPhones-1"><a href="#Using-the-Picture-in-Picture-feature-on-iPhones-1" class="headerlink" title="Using the Picture in Picture feature on iPhones"></a>Using the Picture in Picture feature on iPhones</h3><p>Once you lunch this feature on iOS 14 or greater versions, it automatically shrinks to the top or bottom side of the screen.

Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

A competent video editor will present you with a variety of high-quality editing capabilities that will improve the look and effectiveness of your video.</p><p>In this section, we’ll go over different TikTok video editors so you can make an informed decision:</p><h3 id="How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit TikTok Video Using Wondershare Filmora"></a><strong>How to Edit TikTok Video Using</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_Jk8a-_2oxfhbVB0NEFLk4u7Lj59TOtQlwLb0V2EJFBXF3zrgZwVnAaAp5oEALw_wcB" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>It is available on Windows and Mac.</strong></p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the most favored TikTok video editors, offering a wide range of editing features and settings to help users make the best music and funny videos possible. It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the needed text.</p><p><strong>Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video</strong></p><p>Click the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-20.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Enter in the username of the TikTok account you’d want to save.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-2.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Choose the most appropriate choice from the results page.</li><li>To download, hit the Download button.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>That should do it!

It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the needed text.</p><p><strong>Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video</strong></p><p>Click the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-20.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Enter in the username of the TikTok account you’d want to save.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-2.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Choose the most appropriate choice from the results page.</li><li>To download, hit the Download button.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>That should do it!

You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the needed text.</p><p><strong>Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video</strong></p><p>Click the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-20.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Enter in the username of the TikTok account you’d want to save.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-2.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Choose the most appropriate choice from the results page.</li><li>To download, hit the Download button.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>That should do it!

Design Accessories"></a>1.  Design Accessories</h4><p> If we talk about looks then GoPro Hero4 can be rated as one of the most awesome device and its waterproof housing make it more suitable for adventure sports activities. It comes with so many accessories that help in easy and efficient recording. You can see WiFi and camera recording status on two small slits that are attached to front portion of this camera near the LED screen. On right side of this screen you will find a settings button that also allows users to make settings for Wi-Fi connectivity. The latest design of Hero4 Black makes battery swiping feature much easier and allows users to record videos for longer duration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-hero-black-4.jpg"                      alt="gopro hero black 4"                ></p><p> One of the most interesting features of Hero4 Black is its 4K video resolution ability that can be generated at maximum frame rate of 30fps. You can edit the videos generated by GoPro Hero4 black device and customized results can be obtained. Some of the additional but impressive features of this GoPro device are video mode selection facility, image sharpness, color contrast and low light performance. In case if you want to record videos at 1080p then it is possible to get maximum frame rate of 120fps whereas slow motion recording can also be enabled. For 720p recording you will be glad to access the maximum frame rate of 240fps. Most of users love to enjoy time lapse stitching with GoPro Hero4 Black device.</p><p> On the other side, if we talk about GoPro Hero4 Black picture quality then its f&#x2F;2.8 lens can offer 170 degree wide point of view so that every specific detail can be captured so clearly. It is possible to make selections between 5MP, 7Mp and 12MP modes for stills whereas some users will love to take advantage from night mode and burst mode.</p><p> This device is capable enough to replace most of costly DSLR devices in market and is one step ahead of highest quality mobile phones. You will be able to take benefits from its color modes, exposure tuning, white balance and ISO selectivity. Only drawback of Hero4 Black is its small battery life that can assist you only for one hour when you have enabled Wi-Fi feature.</p><h4 id="2-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2.  Connectivity"></a>2.  Connectivity</h4><p> While talking about all awesome features of GoPro Hero4 Black, how can be forgot to include its connectivity. This device is enabled with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity facility and users can control almost all features from mobile devices using GoPro application. With this advanced software application you can easily preview or playback your recording and once finalized then it can be easily shared on social media websites like Instagram, Facebook as well as via email. If you make use of Bluetooth feature instead of Wi-Fi then its battery can serve you little longer. The smart recording feature allows users to control almost 50 cameras simultaneously at the maximum distance of 600’ line of sight. In the whole GoPro series, GoPro Hero4 Black was the first device that possesses Wi-Fi along with Bluetooth connectivity.</p><h4 id="3-Battery-life-and-Storage-capacity"><a href="#3-Battery-life-and-Storage-capacity" class="headerlink" title="3.  Battery life and Storage capacity"></a>3.  Battery life and Storage capacity</h4><p> This device comes with a 1160mAh battery that can serve you for 1 hour 30 minutes if you are recording at 1080p resolution where frame rate is 30fps, but note that Wi-Fi is disabled. In case if you are using Wi-Fi as well as Smart Phone application then this recording time will naturally fall by 15 minutes. If you want to use this device for full day shooting then i8t is good to go for Wi-Fi disabled mode and bring multiple batteries with you on tour.</p><p> If we talk about the storage offered by GoPro Hero5 black then the bad news is that it does not offer any internal storage but the great feature is that external MicroSD card storage can be extended up to 64 GB. If you are recording in UHD mode at 30fps then it can record maxi8mum up to 2 hours and 20 minutes whereas in case of 1080p at 30 fps you can enjoy long hour recording up to 4 hours 40 minutes.</p><h4 id="4-Live-Streaming"><a href="#4-Live-Streaming" class="headerlink" title="4.  Live Streaming"></a>4.  Live Streaming</h4><p> The coolest option available with GoPro Hero4 Black is its ability to serve for live streaming needs. It is much easier to transfer videos from Camera to smartphone as well as tablet using Wi-Fi connectivity but you need to run Meerkat or LiveStream application on your portable device to make this connection. It will help users to deliver content directly to websites. LiveStream application works perfectly on iOS devices but the videos go to live streamed channel with a delay of 10 seconds at max.</p><p> If you love to share your content online then Hero4 Black could be one of the most superior devices for you. Your breathtaking videos will be definitely joyful for viewers and they will be able to take the crystal clear idea of your adventurous trip.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-line"><a href="#The-Bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom line"></a>The Bottom line</h2><p> Although the video as well as image quality of this device is almost same in case of Hero5 black device but for that you need to pay little higher amount. The cost varies by almost $70 in case of GoPro Hero5 Black, but it has additional features like Digital Image Stabilization, microphone connectivity wi9th much better clarity and wind noise reduction ability. When compared with other competitors, Hero5 Black is proven to be best device for all action camera lovers and it can serve with all amazing features at reasonable price range.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><h5 id="Liza-Brown-1"><a href="#Liza-Brown-1" class="headerlink" title="Liza Brown"></a>Liza Brown</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> In this highly competitive market, GoPro series is providing best services to action camera lovers from so many years.

This device is enabled with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity facility and users can control almost all features from mobile devices using GoPro application. With this advanced software application you can easily preview or playback your recording and once finalized then it can be easily shared on social media websites like Instagram, Facebook as well as via email. If you make use of Bluetooth feature instead of Wi-Fi then its battery can serve you little longer. The smart recording feature allows users to control almost 50 cameras simultaneously at the maximum distance of 600’ line of sight. In the whole GoPro series, GoPro Hero4 Black was the first device that possesses Wi-Fi along with Bluetooth connectivity.</p><h4 id="3-Battery-life-and-Storage-capacity-3"><a href="#3-Battery-life-and-Storage-capacity-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  Battery life and Storage capacity"></a>3.  Battery life and Storage capacity</h4><p> This device comes with a 1160mAh battery that can serve you for 1 hour 30 minutes if you are recording at 1080p resolution where frame rate is 30fps, but note that Wi-Fi is disabled. In case if you are using Wi-Fi as well as Smart Phone application then this recording time will naturally fall by 15 minutes. If you want to use this device for full day shooting then i8t is good to go for Wi-Fi disabled mode and bring multiple batteries with you on tour.</p><p> If we talk about the storage offered by GoPro Hero5 black then the bad news is that it does not offer any internal storage but the great feature is that external MicroSD card storage can be extended up to 64 GB. If you are recording in UHD mode at 30fps then it can record maxi8mum up to 2 hours and 20 minutes whereas in case of 1080p at 30 fps you can enjoy long hour recording up to 4 hours 40 minutes.</p><h4 id="4-Live-Streaming-3"><a href="#4-Live-Streaming-3" class="headerlink" title="4.  Live Streaming"></a>4.  Live Streaming</h4><p> The coolest option available with GoPro Hero4 Black is its ability to serve for live streaming needs. It is much easier to transfer videos from Camera to smartphone as well as tablet using Wi-Fi connectivity but you need to run Meerkat or LiveStream application on your portable device to make this connection. It will help users to deliver content directly to websites. LiveStream application works perfectly on iOS devices but the videos go to live streamed channel with a delay of 10 seconds at max.</p><p> If you love to share your content online then Hero4 Black could be one of the most superior devices for you. Your breathtaking videos will be definitely joyful for viewers and they will be able to take the crystal clear idea of your adventurous trip.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-line-3"><a href="#The-Bottom-line-3" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom line"></a>The Bottom line</h2><p> Although the video as well as image quality of this device is almost same in case of Hero5 black device but for that you need to pay little higher amount. The cost varies by almost $70 in case of GoPro Hero5 Black, but it has additional features like Digital Image Stabilization, microphone connectivity wi9th much better clarity and wind noise reduction ability. When compared with other competitors, Hero5 Black is proven to be best device for all action camera lovers and it can serve with all amazing features at reasonable price range.</p><p><img
