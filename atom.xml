Please explain to me”.</p><p>One of the fascinating aspects of technology is the never-ending innovation. However, TV terminologies can be quite confusing, that even new technologies in the industry become hard to understand.</p><p>Quantum HDR is one of the latest technologies in the TV industry that many folks still find too hard to understand.</p><p>Perhaps you’ve heard about Quantum HDR once or twice, but you still didn’t know what the technology is all about, worry less because you’ve come to the right page to find out the unknown.</p><p>Here, we’ve covered all you need to know about Quantum HDR. So it’s advisable that you read this article till the end.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Quantum-HDR"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Quantum-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Quantum HDR"></a>Part 1: What is Quantum HDR</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/quantum-hdr-everything-you-may-want-to-know-about-quantum-hdr-1.jpg"                      alt="quantum hdr"                ></p><p>Just as the name suggests, Quantum HDR is a combination of two amazing technologies namely, ‘Quantum Dots and HDR (High dynamic range).</p><p>“Quantum HDR refers to TVs with a QLED screen that’s compatible with the HDR technology.”</p><p>As we all know, HDR is used to capture more details and colors in images. So, when used in TVs, it usually affects the color accuracy and contrast ratio in images. Therefore, causing an increase in color accuracy and contrast ratio.</p><p>With the presence of HDR in TVs, bright colors become brighter, and details of pictures become more visible. Yes, it does this by increasing the maximum value for three base colors ‘Red, Green, and Blue’ - this causes colors that originated from the mix of the base colors to be brighter and more saturated.</p><p>Quantum, on the other hand, means a TV uses Quantum Dot technology - a new technology used in TV screens by industry brands like Samsung to capture more details and colors in images.</p><p>Screens made of Quantum Dot technology are also referred to as QLED. Yes, this is because such screens tend to display LED lights that use a unique black light different from other TV screens. So, as a result, TVs with such screens usually have higher brightness and contrast while preserving details of the picture.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-Quantum-HDR-16x-24x-32x-40x"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-Quantum-HDR-16x-24x-32x-40x" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What is Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, 40x?"></a>Part 2: What is Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, 40x?</h2><p>Quantum HDD 16x, 24x, 32x, and 40x are known as peak brightness multipliers of a TV screen. Although there’s clear information about these peak brightness multipliers at this point, we could tell it’s another marketing strategy relating to how many metadata streams a TV’s processor would process to make the image displayed on its screen more detailed. For example, since the base brightness of a TV is 100 units, a Quantum HDR with a 16x peak brightness multiplier would have a peak brightness of 1,600 units, Quantum HDR with a 24x peak brightness multiplier would be 2,400 units, and so on.</p><p>In all, we could say the overall brightness of a Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, and 40x increases as the peak brightness multiplier increases.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-there-a-difference-between-Quantum-HDR-and-HDR"><a href="#Part-3-Is-there-a-difference-between-Quantum-HDR-and-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Is there a difference between Quantum HDR and HDR?"></a>Part 3: Is there a difference between Quantum HDR and HDR?</h2><p>Even though Quantum HDR is a new technology, a lot of people still mistake it to be the same as HDR. So, to help clear the air on the difference between these two techniques, we’ve explained their features in the comparison table below;</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Quantum HDR</strong></th><th><strong>HDR</strong></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Meaning</strong></td><td>Quantum HDR are TVs with QLED screen that’s compatible with HDR technology</td><td>HDR is an advanced technology that improves the quality and display signals of HDR TV (High dynamic range television)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Technology</strong></td><td>-</td><td>High dynamic range televisions</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Brightness</strong></td><td>Much Brighter</td><td>Much brighter</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Best for</strong></td><td>Televisions</td><td>camera</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cost</strong></td><td>$1000+</td><td>$20,000+</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-and-Display-Your-HDR-Video-on-Quantum-HDR-TV"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-and-Display-Your-HDR-Video-on-Quantum-HDR-TV" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make and Display Your HDR Video on Quantum HDR TV?"></a>Part 4: How to Make and Display Your HDR Video on Quantum HDR TV?</h2><p>Truth be told, your TV won’t be able to use HDR unless you’re watching HDR-ready media - It needs a source.

Both of these are compared in detail as below:</p><h4 id="1-Hardware"><a href="#1-Hardware" class="headerlink" title="1.Hardware"></a>1.Hardware</h4><p><strong>Touch Screen:</strong> When displays of both these cameras are compared then it was observed that YI 4K provides better response as compared to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro Hero5 Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Size of display is also larger in case of YI 4K as it goes up to 2.19” whereas Hero5 has 2” screen. The Touch Screen is found more interactive in YI 4K whereas in case of Hero5 you may need to press twice especially when it is wet. The front LCD display of GoPro provides additional settings menu for easy control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yi-4k-touchscreen.jpg"                      alt="Yi 4K action camera touchscreen"                ></p><p> Image source:elproducente.com</p><p><strong>Waterproof:</strong> The biggest benefit of GoPro Hero5 is that it can serve you underwater but YI 4K cannot as you need additional protective case for this camera. But you cannot save your recordings from handling noise in case of GoPro unit. When you go underwater with YI 4K while using protective housing then it is not possible to use its touch screen feature and secondly the audio quality decays by large extent.</p><p><strong>Battery Life:</strong> Both of these camera units come with removable batteries but in case of Hero5 you can enjoy recording only up to 1hr 40 minutes with its 1220mAh battery backup whereas the YI 4K camera is developed with 1400mAh battery that can serve perfectly for 2 hours. Prefer to use these cameras with WiFi connections turned off in order to save battery for longer duration.</p><h4 id="2-Performance"><a href="#2-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2.Performance"></a>2.Performance</h4><p><strong>Image Resolution:</strong> Photo quality of both cameras is 12MP and digital image stabilization feature is added to both units. You can find much warmer and smoother quality with Yi 4K whereas GoPro offers services for RAW photography.</p><p><strong>Video Resolution:</strong> When we talk about the video resolution then different ratings must be compared to get better idea about performance. When we talk about Go Pro Hero5 then maximum video quality is offered to be 4K at 30fps, 2.7k at 60fps, 1080p with 120fps and 720p at 240fps. On the other side in case of Xiaomi YI 4K you will be able to avail 4K at 30fps, 2.5K at 30fps, 1440p with 60fps, 1080p for 120fps and 720p with 200fps only.</p><p><strong>Audio Quality:</strong> Audio Quality of GoPro Hero5 is rated to be much superior as compared to Yi 4K camera unit. The housing helps to protect Hero5 from wind noise but it can perform even better without housing as compared to Yi 4K. Hero5 Black comes with 3 microphones and it helps to make better selection for audio streams.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> GoPro Hero5 can be ordered online with a payment of $399 but you will be glad to know that equally featured Xiaomi Yi Action Camera is cheaper as well as affordable with a price tag of $199.99 only. When we compare specs and hardware of both these cameras then Yi 4K is observed to provide all desired high performance results while meeting all needs of sports persons so you can think of buying Xiaomi product that falls in your budget.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p> Almost all features are discussed above and it is observed that if you are searching for a camera to record videos underwater or in rainy seasons then it is best idea to invest on GoPro Hero5 but in case of other adventurous sports activities Yi 4K can also provide you impressive results and it is a fit to budget camera unit. The Video and Photo quality is almost similar for both units but the battery backup of Yi 4K is again better then GoPro unit. So it is better to decide your budget and needs first and then pick the right camera unit for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-practices-for-b-roll-utilization-for-2024/"><u>Best Practices for B-Roll Utilization for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/winning-insta-followers-with-irresistible-unboxing-clips/"><u>Winning Insta Followers with Irresistible Unboxing Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-complete-user-experience-with-vsco-camera-app/"><u>2024 Approved  Complete User Experience with VSCO Camera App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-concoct-laughter-in-image-format-giphy-style/"><u>[New] Concoct Laughter in Image Format, Giphy Style</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/enhance-browsing-with-effortless-side-by-side-view-on-chromes-fullscreen/"><u>Enhance Browsing with Effortless Side-by-Side View on Chrome's Fullscreen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/the-versatility-of-virtual-worlds/"><u>The Versatility of Virtual Worlds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/conquering-podcast-title-creativity-a-comprehensive-tutorial-and-idea-list/"><u>Conquering Podcast Title Creativity  A Comprehensive Tutorial & Idea List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-accessing-zoom-directly-from-google-mail-interface/"><u>[Updated] Accessing Zoom Directly From Google Mail Interface</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-2022s-pinnacle-moments-in-snowboarding-x/"><u>2024 Approved  2022'S Pinnacle Moments in Snowboarding X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/the-best-android-sim-unlock-code-generators-unlock-your-oppo-reno-10-pro-5g-phone-hassle-free-by-drfone-android/"><u>The Best Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Unlock Your Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G Phone Hassle-Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-facebooks-live-features-for-optimal-performance/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Facebook's Live Features for Optimal Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-mp3-conversion-tools-for-mac-users/"><u>2024 Approved Top MP3 Conversion Tools for Mac Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-quick-guide-how-to-download-windows-movie-maker-6/"><u>[New] Quick Guide  How to Download Windows Movie Maker 6</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-deleted-htc-u23-pictures-an-easy-method-explained-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/"><u>How to Restore Deleted HTC U23 Pictures  An Easy Method Explained.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/the-essential-list-of-gratuitous-quality-memes/"><u>The Essential List of Gratuitous, Quality Memes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/how-to-perfectly-use-canva-color-match-in-2024/"><u>How to Perfectly Use Canva Color Match, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/free-gaming-paradise-top-10-download-sites-for-pc-and-android/"><u>Free Gaming Paradise Top 10 Download Sites for PC and Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-resize-images-with-ease-9-online-ratio-changers/"><u>New Resize Images with Ease 9 Online Ratio Changers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-quicknetflix-screenshots-a-mac-users-guide/"><u>[New] In 2024, QuickNetflix Screenshots  A Mac User's Guide</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Nevertheless, if you want to just burn the video to DVD (with some basic video editing options) — Wondershare’s DVD Creator is the way to go!</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-luts-ranked-top-10-in-photoshop-and-lightroom/"><u>2024 Approved  Best LUTs Ranked  Top 10 in Photoshop & Lightroom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-performers-top-10-innovative-4k-mirrorless-models/"><u>In 2024, Best Performers  Top 10 Innovative 4K Mirrorless Models</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-35plus-smiles-with-photo-alterations-ios-android-compatible/"><u>2024 Approved  35+ Smiles with Photo Alterations  IOS, Android Compatible</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-achieving-gentle-volume-alteration-using-fl-studio/"><u>2024 Approved  Achieving Gentle Volume Alteration Using FL Studio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-beat-the-hate-smoothly-add-tracks-into-your-video-on-windows-11/"><u>[Updated] Beat the Hate  Smoothly Add Tracks Into Your Video on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/examining-performance-of-dji-raptor-eyewear/"><u>Examining Performance of DJI Raptor Eyewear</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/top-drone-tech-leading-gimbals-ranked/"><u>Top Drone Tech  Leading Gimbals Ranked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/limb-the-popularity-ladder-essential-youtube-seo-practices-uncovered/"><u>[New] Climb the Popularity Ladder  Essential YouTube SEO Practices Uncovered</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-effective-ways-to-unlock-icloud-account-without-password-from-apple-iphone-14-pro-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, 3 Effective Ways to Unlock iCloud Account Without Password From Apple iPhone 14 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ilmoras-blueprint-for-stellar-youtube-trailers/"><u>[New] Filmora's Blueprint for Stellar YouTube Trailers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/2024-approved-cut-vlc-videos-on-mac-without-compromise-top-trimming-method/"><u>2024 Approved Cut VLC Videos on Mac Without Compromise Top Trimming Method</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-exploring-the-eminent-on-niche-focused-instagram-groups/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Exploring the Eminent on Niche-Focused Instagram Groups</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-stealthy-strategies-for-eliminating-hashtags/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Stealthy Strategies for Eliminating Hashtags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-snapchat-pins-a-complete-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  Mastering Snapchat Pins  A Complete Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-is-itops-performance-worth-your-investment/"><u>2024 Approved  Is ITop's Performance Worth Your Investment?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-screen-recordings-the-recmeister-way/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Screen Recordings  The Recmeister Way</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Advanced-Techniques-for-Proximity-Viewing-in-Roblox"><a href="#Advanced-Techniques-for-Proximity-Viewing-in-Roblox" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Techniques for Proximity Viewing in Roblox"></a>Advanced Techniques for Proximity Viewing in Roblox</h2><p>Now a days, Roblox has more than 43 million daily active users. We’ve all seen the Roblox TikTok, videos, and screenshots of people using the site to play games. Roblox is a sizable platform for creating, sharing, and playing games that is notably well-liked among younger audiences. As a result, we’ve all definitely pondered at some time how those players of Roblox are able to zoom in on Roblox so freely and effortlessly. We’ve experimented with a few Roblox games and found a few quick techniques for quickly zooming in and out of Roblox games on a laptop. If you’re playing Roblox on your laptop for the first time, you may be having problems locating the zoom in and zoom out keys. No need to worry; we already know the keys to utilize in Roblox to zoom in and out and stated the how to zoom in on Roblox laptop ways here.</p><p>The modern gamers have made Roblox the center of attention on social media, where it has become the leading game that enables character creation and modification of minigames. However, using the camera might be challenging for novice users, so in this post, we’ll look at how to zoom in on Roblox. Numerous games may be played for free online on Roblox. To be successful, each game on the website could need a certain set of strategies and tactics. As a consequence, many users who are playing Roblox for the first time are unsure of how to zoom in or out when playing on their computers. We’re here to provide you with some answers, however. Simply refer to the detailed instructions provided below to understand how to zoom in and out in Roblox.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Zoom-In-Out-with-Keyboard-Shortcut"><a href="#Way-1-Zoom-In-Out-with-Keyboard-Shortcut" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Zoom In&#x2F;Out with Keyboard Shortcut"></a>Way 1. Zoom In&#x2F;Out with Keyboard Shortcut</h2><p>You’ve been looking at your screen nonstop, but you can’t figure out what it says. You could find the answer you’re searching for by zooming in on your computer. The majority of simple tasks may be performed with the keyboard, such as moving an item using the W, A, S, and D keys, but you can rotate the environment or zoom in and out using the trackpad. By the way, you may move the game’s camera by using the navigation buttons. For instance, in the Roblox game, the numerical keys on the keyboard may be used to modify the objects’ seating positions as well as the weapons and equipment they are carrying. And don’t worry, zooming in and out is not a difficult task. You really have a wide variety of methods to zoom in and out of your Roblox PC depending on your preferences.</p><p><strong>Steps to Zoom in on Roblox with Keyboard:</strong></p><p>Step1To start playing, you must first sign into Roblox using your browser. Go to the Roblox website in your favourite web browser by opening it. Start a testing game session after logging in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/login-to-roblox-site.jpg"                      alt="login to roblox site"                ></p><p>Step2Now, all you have to do to zoom in is hit the ‘I’ key on your keyboard, which is located between the ‘U’ and ‘O’ keys.</p><p>Step3If you press or hold this, you’ll probably enter first-person perspective, where you can’t zoom in any more. If you’re already somewhat out of focus, however, you’ll first zoom in toward your character before entering first-person view.</p><p>Step4Simply press the ‘O’ key on your keyboard (the letter between ‘P’ and ‘I’ on a QWERTY keyboard) to zoom out. You may hit “O” as many as you wish or hold it down while you do so to increase the zoom to its highest setting.</p><p>Step5To get the playing zoom level you desire, press “I” and “O” together. You must consequently mix the actions of these two keyboard keys in order to zoom in at the most pleasing scale.</p><h2 id="Way-2-Zoom-In-Out-in-Roblox-with-Mouse-Control"><a href="#Way-2-Zoom-In-Out-in-Roblox-with-Mouse-Control" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Zoom In&#x2F;Out in Roblox with Mouse Control"></a>Way 2. Zoom In&#x2F;Out in Roblox with Mouse Control</h2><p>With over half of all Roblox users being under the age of 16, it is likely that you already know the mouse zooming method. Roblox is one of the most well-known gaming and playing networks for youngsters. To move the camera in all directions, hold down the right mouse button or right mouse click. This control is available in all of Roblox’s games. If your mouse is compatible, you can enable Smart Zoom in the Mouse Preferences and zoom with only a single finger double-tap. You may choose other zoom settings, such as whether to zoom the whole screen or only a portion of it. But you must do certain actions in order to change the camera and mouse sensitivity.</p><p><strong>Steps to Zoom in on Roblox with Mouse</strong></p><p>Step1Go to the Roblox website in your favourite web browser by opening it. Start a testing game session after logging in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/start-testing-game-session-roblox.jpg"                      alt="start testing game session roblox"                ></p><p>Step2Once your gaming session has begun, you may zoom by using the wheel while moving ahead. Once again, if you scroll all the way down, this action will put you in first person perspective. Now all you have to do is use your cursor to scroll ahead to zoom in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-in-with-cursoe-scroll.jpg"                      alt="zoom in with cursoe scroll"                ></p><p>Step3When the game’s map is in your field of vision and you reach the maximum zoom level, just scroll backward with your mouse to zoom out. It will be essential to do the opposite operation, namely scroll the other direction, to zoom out on your character, in order to zoom in.</p><p>Step4In order to play at your selected zoom level, scroll backwards and forth. Because your character will be presented in such tiny type, it will be challenging to play comfortably and see it clearly. Therefore, maintaining balance is crucial in order to have the zoom adjusted to your preferred playing style.</p><h2 id="Way-3-Use-Xbox-Controller-Thumbsticks-to-Zoom"><a href="#Way-3-Use-Xbox-Controller-Thumbsticks-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Use Xbox Controller Thumbsticks to Zoom"></a>Way 3. Use Xbox Controller Thumbsticks to Zoom</h2><p>The amount of mouse usage varies greatly depending on the kind of game being played, with racing games requiring the least amount of mouse use and first-person shooter games requiring the most. Nevertheless, there are several methods to play every game without a mouse. Since the Roblox platform makes it possible to create games, the game’s creator mostly determines the control parameters. In such scenario, you also need a trackpad since using the keyboard could prevent you from accessing some menu options. The good news for Xbox players is that you may do so by using the Thumb sticks.</p><p><strong>Steps to Zoom in on Roblox with Xbox Controller:</strong></p><p>Step1There is a simple and convenient technique to manage the zoom while playing Roblox on the Xbox. Push the R3 button on your controller, which corresponds to the right stick click, to enable the zoom feature. Additionally, you may depress the right thumbstick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/push-r3-button-controller.jpg"                      alt="push r3 button ontroller"                ></p><p>Step2Zoom in by pressing forward on the right thumbstick that has been clicked down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/press-forward-right-thumbstick.jpg"                      alt="press forward right thumbstick"                ></p><p>Step3Pull rearward on the clicked-down right thumbstick to zoom out. The same joystick (right) must constantly be pulled rearward to zoom out.</p><h2 id="Way-4-Zoom-in-out-in-Roblox-on-Tablet"><a href="#Way-4-Zoom-in-out-in-Roblox-on-Tablet" class="headerlink" title="Way 4. Zoom in&#x2F;out in Roblox on Tablet"></a>Way 4. Zoom in&#x2F;out in Roblox on Tablet</h2><p>There are hundreds of games available on the platform that you may play for free online. Each game on the internet could have a distinct set of playstyles and strategies. As a result, many new users who play Roblox on a tablet wonder how to zoom in or out. Tablets are handy and portable, but certain text and photos might be difficult to view on the tiny displays. Although there are zooming options on all tablets, you may find yourself scrolling down and swiping more often to access websites. The precise procedure you must use to zoom in and out on your tablet varies on the tablet type, but the following are some key points to keep in mind.</p><p><strong>Steps to Zoom in on Roblox on Tablet</strong></p><p>Step1Open the Roblox app, sign in, and then start a test gaming session. The first is to guide your camera by pressing the right and left directional arrows, however this method is problematic since it involves using the keyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-in-roblox-teblet.jpg"                      alt="zoom in roblox teblet"                ></p><p>Step2To zoom, just use two fingers and slide them apart (for zooming in) or together (for zooming out) like you would to do so on a smartphone (zoom out).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-roblox-with-fingers.jpg"                      alt="zoom roblox with fingers"                ></p><p>Step3You will be given the best method using the touchpad: while holding down the right side, move the screen to view your character from the front and from behind!</p><p>Step4The camera angle and&#x2F;or your character will only move if one of your fingers, preferably the index, remains steady on the screen. This will prevent the zoom level from changing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-character-on-roblox.jpg"                      alt="zoom character on roblox"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>You may wish to change your viewpoint when playing games on Roblox, the most cutting-edge game creation and sharing platform in the world.

In other words, these videos’ frames are captured at a much lower rate than normal and when the video is played, it seems to be playing faster. For instance, you might have watched many videos where the clouds are running too fast or the sunset process is happening quickly or maybe traffic is pacing up too much.

The main camera app holds the feature and you can create stunning hyper lapse on Android device yourself. However, you are required to be without your device for an extended period of time as time-lapse video requires keeping the phone in a static position. Let us now understand how you can take time lapse on Android without further ado.</p><ul><li>Take your Android device and open the camera.</li><li>Next, switch to the video mode.</li><li>In the last, choose time lapse and begin to shoot your task.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/take-time-lapse-video-android.JPG"                      alt="take time lapse video"                ></p><h2 id="Part2-Notes-you-should-know"><a href="#Part2-Notes-you-should-know" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Notes you should know"></a>Part2: Notes you should know</h2><p>When you have decided to shoot a time-lapse video, here are some important things you should take notice of.

We also think you should know how hyper-lapse and time-lapse distinguishes from each other. These two techniques are not same. The technique of hyper-lapse video includes a moving camera in contrast with the time-lapse videos. It is part of time-lapse videography where the camera is moving at different angles and exposures. Keeping it simpler, a time-lapse video is made with keeping camera undisturbed whereas hyper-lapse videos involverecording the video while moving the camera.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Now you have mastered everything about time-lapse videos and time lapse apps on Android.

Whatever your reason for creating this effect, you can customize it thoroughly and get a result that completely meets your requirements.</p><p>This guide will show you the step-by-step process of creating a 3D text effect in Adobe Illustrator. So, if you’re ready, let’s begin.</p><h2 id="What-You-Need-to-Create-a-3D-Text-Effect-in-Adobe-Illustrator"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Create-a-3D-Text-Effect-in-Adobe-Illustrator" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Create a 3D Text Effect in Adobe Illustrator"></a>What You Need to Create a 3D Text Effect in Adobe Illustrator</h2><p>All you need are ten minutes of your time and the Adobe Illustrator application. Oh yes, and you need a little bit of imagination as well. That’s all there is to it.</p><p>After you get the program, install it and follow the step-by-step instructions you’ll see below.</p><p>Also, there are plenty of different ways to create 3D text effects in Adobe Illustrator. This tutorial will focus on explaining the easiest and quickest one. Just know that this doesn’t mean the result will be wrong. Most methods yield the same results.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-3D-Text-Effects-in-Adobe-Illustrator"><a href="#How-to-Create-3D-Text-Effects-in-Adobe-Illustrator" class="headerlink" title="How to Create 3D Text Effects in Adobe Illustrator"></a>How to Create 3D Text Effects in Adobe Illustrator</h2><p>Now that you know what you’re getting into, let’s finally reveal the entire process. Just follow the steps and do as you see here.</p><p>Step1 Open the program and start a new project.</p><p>Step2 Click on the <strong>Type tool</strong> and click anywhere on your blank canvas. Then, type in your text—type in anything you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-illustrator-type-tool.png"                      alt="type tool illustrator"                ></p><p>Step3 Now, look at the bottom-right corner of the program. Find the <strong>Font</strong> settings and change your font type and size to anything you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-illustrator-font.png"                      alt="change font illustrator"                ></p><p>Step4 Next, choose any color you want for your text from the panel on the screen’s left side.

Make a detailed profile if you are an artist</h3><p>While creating a Spotify profile, keep it detailed with all information (especially if you are an artist or a podcaster), like bio, social links, upcoming shows, merchandise, and more.

So if you are thinking to buy a new camera for your adventurous tours then you need to make a careful decision out of all existing competitive brands. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Xiaomi YI 4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the highly rated action camera under this competing category.

Both of these are compared in detail as below:</p><h4 id="1-Hardware"><a href="#1-Hardware" class="headerlink" title="1.Hardware"></a>1.Hardware</h4><p><strong>Touch Screen:</strong> When displays of both these cameras are compared then it was observed that YI 4K provides better response as compared to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro Hero5 Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Size of display is also larger in case of YI 4K as it goes up to 2.19” whereas Hero5 has 2” screen. The Touch Screen is found more interactive in YI 4K whereas in case of Hero5 you may need to press twice especially when it is wet. The front LCD display of GoPro provides additional settings menu for easy control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yi-4k-touchscreen.jpg"                      alt="Yi 4K action camera touchscreen"                ></p><p> Image source:elproducente.com</p><p><strong>Waterproof:</strong> The biggest benefit of GoPro Hero5 is that it can serve you underwater but YI 4K cannot as you need additional protective case for this camera. But you cannot save your recordings from handling noise in case of GoPro unit. When you go underwater with YI 4K while using protective housing then it is not possible to use its touch screen feature and secondly the audio quality decays by large extent.</p><p><strong>Battery Life:</strong> Both of these camera units come with removable batteries but in case of Hero5 you can enjoy recording only up to 1hr 40 minutes with its 1220mAh battery backup whereas the YI 4K camera is developed with 1400mAh battery that can serve perfectly for 2 hours. Prefer to use these cameras with WiFi connections turned off in order to save battery for longer duration.</p><h4 id="2-Performance"><a href="#2-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2.Performance"></a>2.Performance</h4><p><strong>Image Resolution:</strong> Photo quality of both cameras is 12MP and digital image stabilization feature is added to both units. You can find much warmer and smoother quality with Yi 4K whereas GoPro offers services for RAW photography.</p><p><strong>Video Resolution:</strong> When we talk about the video resolution then different ratings must be compared to get better idea about performance. When we talk about Go Pro Hero5 then maximum video quality is offered to be 4K at 30fps, 2.7k at 60fps, 1080p with 120fps and 720p at 240fps. On the other side in case of Xiaomi YI 4K you will be able to avail 4K at 30fps, 2.5K at 30fps, 1440p with 60fps, 1080p for 120fps and 720p with 200fps only.</p><p><strong>Audio Quality:</strong> Audio Quality of GoPro Hero5 is rated to be much superior as compared to Yi 4K camera unit. The housing helps to protect Hero5 from wind noise but it can perform even better without housing as compared to Yi 4K. Hero5 Black comes with 3 microphones and it helps to make better selection for audio streams.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> GoPro Hero5 can be ordered online with a payment of $399 but you will be glad to know that equally featured Xiaomi Yi Action Camera is cheaper as well as affordable with a price tag of $199.99 only. When we compare specs and hardware of both these cameras then Yi 4K is observed to provide all desired high performance results while meeting all needs of sports persons so you can think of buying Xiaomi product that falls in your budget.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p> Almost all features are discussed above and it is observed that if you are searching for a camera to record videos underwater or in rainy seasons then it is best idea to invest on GoPro Hero5 but in case of other adventurous sports activities Yi 4K can also provide you impressive results and it is a fit to budget camera unit. The Video and Photo quality is almost similar for both units but the battery backup of Yi 4K is again better then GoPro unit. So it is better to decide your budget and needs first and then pick the right camera unit for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-10-secret-tips-to-better-use-canva-photo-editor/"><u>[Updated] 10 Secret Tips to Better Use Canva Photo Editor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-adept-at-editing-and-disc-making-the-ultimate-mac-guide/"><u>[New] Adept at Editing and Disc Making  The Ultimate Mac Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/deciding-on-showcasing-your-off-facebook-journey/"><u>Deciding on Showcasing Your Off-Facebook Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/in-2024-aero-tech-machine-varieties/"><u>In 2024, Aero Tech  Machine Varieties</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-guide-to-add-chapters-to-a-youtube-video/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Guide to Add Chapters To A YouTube Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/simple-setup-winning-the-art-of-fishy-voice-transformation/"><u>Simple Setup  Winning the Art of Fishy Voice Transformation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/apples-m1-pro-versus-the-powerhouse-m1-max-what-to-note/"><u>Apple's M1 Pro Versus the Powerhouse M1 Max - What to Note?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-the-future-workplace-with-vr-technology/"><u>2024 Approved  Crafting the Future Workplace with VR Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/pushing-the-envelope-in-display-technology-detailed-examination-of-benq-bl2711u/"><u>Pushing the Envelope in Display Technology  Detailed Examination of BenQ BL2711U</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/vlc-vs-mpc-battle-of-the-best-free-video-player/"><u>VLC Vs.

Ableton Live is one of the greatest DAWs to learn if you’re just beginning to make beats or write songs. For many artists, Ableton Live has emerged as the preferred setting for writing music with an eye on live performance. If you’re coming from a conventionally built digital audio workstation, Live’s approach to composition and arrangement is undoubtedly odd.</p><p>One of the most user-friendly pieces of music software ever created is Ableton Live. With a little instruction, you can quickly master Ableton fade and produce recordings of studio-caliber. Since then, Ableton has emerged as one of the top names in electronic music production. Live is a robust DAW with mature capabilities that can be used to produce any kind of music, although it works especially well with certain processes. Follow this guide to learn about Ableton fade in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-1-2-Ways-to-Fade-audio-in-Ableton"><a href="#Part-1-2-Ways-to-Fade-audio-in-Ableton" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. 2 Ways to Fade audio in Ableton"></a>Part 1. 2 Ways to Fade audio in Ableton</h2><p>You’ve certainly heard the terms “audio fade-in” and “audio fade-out” a few times as a newbie, and you may be wondering what they mean and how you might apply them to your films. Crossfading clips on the same track is easier and only needs one track, however crossfading clips on different tracks allows you to apply independent audio effects processing and gives greater flexibility in structuring the fade curves. Both strategies may be helpful for organizing and creating sounds.</p><h3 id="Way-1-Use-Warp-Fades"><a href="#Way-1-Use-Warp-Fades" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Use Warp&#x2F;Fades"></a>Way 1. Use Warp&#x2F;Fades</h3><p>To avoid any clicks, turn on Create Fades on Clip Edges in the Record&#x2F;Warp&#x2F;Launch section of Live’s Preferences. The beginning and ending of the Clip will each have a little fade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-fades-warp-fades.jpg"                      alt="create fades warp fades"                ></p><p>You must disable the automated mode in order to alter the clip fades. You may accomplish this by doing the following:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/disable-automated-mode-ableton.jpg"                      alt="disable automated mode ableton"                ></p><p>The fade-in and fade-out handles should display when you hover the mouse icon over the audio clip you want to fade. In case, if they don’t, hit ‘A’ on your keyboard to make them appear. Then, you hold down the mouse button while left-clicking on the handle you wish to fade and lowering the fader.</p><h3 id="Way-2-Using-the-MIDI-Track"><a href="#Way-2-Using-the-MIDI-Track" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Using the MIDI Track"></a>Way 2. Using the MIDI Track</h3><p>In the method 2, you can use it on MIDI track. It will load the Utility effect to the specified MIDI track wherever you drag it on the track. Left-click on the little box in the bottom right corner of the DAW to view the Utility effect on your track. Follow the procedure below to do so.<br>Live’s ability to easily clean up the beginning and conclusion of audio samples has long been one of its strengths. Simply hit A and hover over the clip to check sure Automation Mode isn’t turned on. There are two handles you may drag on the left and right, as well as two curve adjusters:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/midi-track-ableton.jpg"                      alt="midi track ableton"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Alternative-way-to-Fade-Audio-without-Ableton"><a href="#Part-2-Alternative-way-to-Fade-Audio-without-Ableton" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.
