The article concludes that AndroVid is a helpful app for android users to turn a simple video into a fabulous masterpiece. What makes it unique is its free version with limitations is still far better than any other android app. However, you can surely switch to AndroVid pro for a more advanced experience. But when you want some editing alternative for AndroVid on desktop, then Wondershare Filmora is highly recommended. Thanks for reading.
