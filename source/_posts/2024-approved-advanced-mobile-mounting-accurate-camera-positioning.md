### 4\. Zhiyun Smooth 4

This one lives up to its tagline, ‘born for the mobile filmmakers’ owing to its superior features that assist you in creating professional content.

**Key Features:**

* Focus Pull and Zoom

Smooth 4 operates on an inbuilt handwheel configured into a focus puller that makes the experience so smooth. That combined with the powerful Phone Go Mode, whether its zooming or switching focus, the transition will never disrupt the aesthetics with this auto-follow camera mount.

_With 200° tilt and 300° pan object tracking._

* Voice and Gesture Control

Gone are the days you needed to rely on remotes only to forget where you left them. Train your PivoPod (by feeding them voice and gesture data) and simply have it follow your commands anywhere, anytime.

* Remote Control

Too far or busy to control with voice? PivoPod is prepared for every scenario with its remote control option.

**Supported Devices:**

Only compatible with smartphones.

### 5\. PivoPod

Do you dream of a cameraman that follows you around, obeys your commands on the flick of your finger, captures your precious moments most beautifully, and doesn’t get drained out too soon? With unbeatable features, unreal precision, unprecedented tracking sensitivity, and super attractive price, PivoPod might just be the auto-tracking camera mount you’re looking for.

The automatic tracking feature of this cameraman in the face of a camera mount is equipped with additional intuitive technologies that enable autofocus as well as auto-zoom. So you not only have a bot that follows you around but also one that captures the best shots.

**Key Features:**

* Video Calling and Live Streaming

Pivo saves you the time, energy, and hassle to detach, scroll, and switch. With its multitasking features, you can not just record your moments of movement but also stream them live or on a video call! Present, dance around, or simply enjoy animated actions with auto track on your calls.

* Voice and Gesture Control

Gone are the days you needed to rely on remotes only to forget where you left them. Train your PivoPod (by feeding them voice and gesture data) and simply have it follow your commands anywhere, anytime.

* Remote Control

Too far or busy to control with voice? PivoPod is prepared for every scenario with its remote control option.

**Supported Devices:**

Only compatible with smartphones.

**Automatic Object Tracking Performance Rating: 4.8/5**
_With 360° object tracking._

**Pricing: $109**

## **Which Camera Mount Should You Buy?**

All in all, each camera mount comes with its own USP, and you have to make a choice based on your priorities. When on a tight budget, you can compromise a bit on visual flexibility and go for Zhiyun Smooth 4\. For your DSLRs, nothing can beat Crane 2, just like Pivo is an undefeatable frontrunner for mobile phones.
