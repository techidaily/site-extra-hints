 If you are looking for affordable drones under $500 that works with GoPro then the 3D Solo should be right up your street.

You can use the included remote to control both the camera and drone so no fiddling about and it can take off automatically and return home with just one button being pressed to action it. Footage can be saved directly to your phone and you can get rid of unwanted footage in flight making it easier to store the parts you want to and make later editing easier.

This clever drone even includes a simulator for you to practice before using your drone which is great for those that want to perfect their flying skills. The battery lasts for up to 20 minutes of in-flight action per charge and to keep track there is a battery status so you don't run out in the middle of the flight.
