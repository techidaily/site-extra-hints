 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Resizing images is a routine step during the photo editing process. The size of all photos is often reduced in order to make a picture better suited for use on social media. On the other hand, enlarging a photo can be more complicated than it sounds. Increasing the overall number of pixels in a photo can easily cause pixelization, especially if the original photo was in low resolution. Blurriness, JPEG compression artifacts or image noise are also among frequent unwanted side effects of blowing up digital images.

Choosing the right software can help you avoid the potential dangers of enlarging images, which is the reason why we are going to take you through some of the best online as well as Mac and PC-based image enlargers.

## Enlarging Photos Online Without Compromising Quality

The resolution of an image determines how much that image can be enlarged without losing any quality. For instance, if the photoâ€™s resolution is 600x400 pixels, trying to increase it up to 4000x3000 pixels can cause **blurriness or pixelization**. Letâ€™s have a look at some of the best online tools for enlarging low-resolution photos, without compromising their quality.

In the **Resize Your Image section** of the webpage youâ€™ll be able to spot a **Scale slider**, but **its value canâ€™t exceed 100%,** which means that you canâ€™t use it to enlarge images.

![ best image enlarger ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resizeimage-online-image-enlarger-2.jpg)

Make sure that the **Keep Aspect Ratio** checkbox is selected to avoid distorting the picture, and then proceed to increase the values in the **Width and Height boxes**. If the original file had a width value of 1200 pixels you can double it to 2400 pixels without any risk of quality loss. The **height value** will be **adjusted automatically** if the Keep Aspect Ratio option is enabled. The new size of the photo will be displayed at the bottom of the screen. Directly above it is the **Resize button**, click on it and then click on the **Download Image button** to save a photo to a hard drive.

This simple online image enlarger is based on a **Deep Convolutional Neural Network** and it can also produce the **Anime style art**. You can import an image by either **copying its URL** or by clicking on the **Choose a File button**. After you upload a photo you can choose between **Artwork and Photo styles**, select the **Photo option** and set a new level **of Noise Reduction**. When done, pick the **Upscaling option** that best fits the picture youâ€™re enlarging and then click on the **Convert icon** to complete the process. Even though Waifu2x lets its users upscale images effortlessly, its tools are rudimentary. Using a more powerful photo editor will grant you more control over the photo enlargement process.

![ best image enlarger ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/a-sharper-scaling-image-enlarge.jpg)

Besides enlarging images this software can also be helpful for lens and perspective correction or image rotation. Additionally, A Sharper Scaling lets you zoom in on a detail of a photo and enlarge it while maintaining a solid level of sharpness in the image. You can choose from a number of interpolation options that make the resized images smoother and less pixelated. The bulk processing option is available as well, so you can blow up hundreds of photos at the same time. The maximum file size cannot exceed 50MB, which is more than enough to ensure the high quality of all images you enlarge with this software.

#### 3. [Stoik Smart Resizer](http://www.stoik.com/products/photo/STOIK-Smart-Resizer/)

**Price:** $51

**Compatibility:** Windows XP or later

![ best image enlarger ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stoik-image-enlarger.jpg)

Reducing the size of an image or increasing it, is simple because the software uses algorithms that automatically analyze the picture and help the program produce stunning interpolation results. For instance, The Smart Resize Algorithm can enlarge a photo up to 1000% of the original size while maintaining a relatively high image quality. This image enlarger is equipped with batch processing tools, so its users can upscale or downscale large numbers of images in a short period of time. Stoik Smart Resizer is mobile friendly and it can be used to enlarge pictures taken with a Smartphone, a feature that is quite useful if you want to print your photos.

#### 4. [PhotoZoom Pro 7](http://www.benvista.com/photozoompro)

**Price:** $159.00

**Compatibility:** Mac, Windows

![ best image enlarger ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photozoom-pro7-image-larger.jpg)

JPEG compression artifacts and noise can often ruin an enlarged picture, and for that reason, this software offers a number of powerful tools that effectively remove these distortions and improve the quality of upscaled photos. The software lets you create files that can have more than 50MB and its highly praised S-Spline Max image resize technology is designed to preserve sharpness and details of the objects in enlarged pictures. You can choose from a huge number of presets that can be manually adjusted or create your own preset resize method you can use whenever youâ€™re enlarging photos. PhotoZoom Pro 7 is a powerful image enlarger that makes resizing social media content a fun process.

Preparing print materials or simply making your digital images larger is what Fotophire Photo Maximizer does best since it can enlarge photos up to 1000% of their original size. In the softwareâ€™s Batch Mode you can upscale a thousand images with a single command. The Denoise tool enables you to reduce blur and pixelation with just a click, while the Improved Edges feature helps you preserve clarity when you enlarge a picture significantly. Fotophire Photo Maximizer lets you save your own presets so you donâ€™t have to go through the same process every time you want to enlarge a photo. The software also provides basic Color Correction tools, that can help you make the colors in the enlarged photo more vivid.

#### 6. [Blow Up](https://www.alienskin.com/blowup/)

**Price:** Free trial available, $99

**Compatibility:** Mac, Windows

![ best image enlarger ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blowup-image-enlarger.jpg)

This Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom plugin is designed to help professional photographers and digital printmakers to enlarge their images. Unfortunately, you canâ€™t use BlowUp as a standalone software, which makes it a great choice only for Mac and PC users who already have Adobeâ€™s photo editing programs installed on their computers. The plugin offers a number of ways to keep edges sharp without introducing JPEG compression artifacts and it features a number of presets that allow you to quickly adjust the size of the picture to the format in which you want to print it. The best part is that Blow Up can handle images in CMYK mode that is used in offset printing.

#### 7. [Adobe Photoshop CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopfamily.html)

**Price:** Subscription plans start from $9.99 per month

**Compatibility:** Mac, Windows

![ best image enlarger ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-photoshop-image-enlarger.jpg)

Adobe Photoshop became famous for its versatility because it is hard to think of a photo editing option this software doesnâ€™t feature. Changing the size of a photo in the Adobeâ€™s highly praised photo editor is a simple task since you just have to go to the Image drop-down menu, and select the Image Size option. Once the Image Size window pops up on your screen you just have to adjust the Pixel Dimensions or Document Size values. Adobe Photoshop also features a number of interpolation presets, such as Nearest Neighbor, or Bicubic Smoother that keep the enlarged images sharps and prevent pixelization.

## FAQ: Discover More about Image Enlargers

#### 1\. How do I make a picture bigger without losing quality?

It is pretty easy. All you need is a high-quality image enlarger. We recommend online tools like PhotoEnlarger and ResizeImage because they are free yet excellent. Besides, you can choose to download some software like PhotoZoom or Reshade Image Resizer to enlarge images without losing quality.

#### 2\. Why are my photos blurry when I zoom in?

Digital images consist of pixels. When enlarging the pictures, the pixels get extended too much to fit the large dimensions, so the photos become blurry.

Just as the way of enlarging a photo, you need a tool to resize images. All you have to do is follow the instructions of the software.
