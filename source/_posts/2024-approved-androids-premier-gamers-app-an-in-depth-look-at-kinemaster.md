## Part 6\. The best KineMaster App Alternative on Desktop

Although you can also use the KineMaster app on a desktop by following the instructions above, it can still not compete with any desktop video editor as they have much more powerful and advanced editing tools. So, it's better to use any of its alternatives on the desktop instead of using it.

So, the question now is: Which of its desktop alternatives is the best? It's called [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Considering that it offers a number of cutting-edge features that KineMaster is missing as well. Including motion tracking, keyframing, speed ramping, auto beat sync, Boris FX, NewBlue FX, and many more. Also, its export quality is highly better than KineMaster's as well.
