To achieve this, choose the Automation Curve Tool by clicking on the Tool Selector at the top of the Arrangement View. Then, left-click and drag your automation point up or down between the points.

### Method 2: Employ the Fade-Out Tool

The fading-out process has additional option in Logic Pro. An audio track will fade out if the "Fade Out" slider is used. The audio will progressively fade away as a result. Then, to make an audio zone sound exactly like a "Crossfade-out" region, use the "Fade Out" slider. The fade tool offers an even simpler method for creating a fade out. However, keep in mind that this technique is limited to audio files and tracks. You'll be able to see the cross-fade in action after you've applied it.

Step1 Navigate to the Tool Selector located at the Region View's top. Select the Fade Tool by expanding it.

Step3 The "Fade Out" option may also be used to manage how quickly an area fades out. You must first choose an area and then press the "Fade Out" slider to do this. A playhead may regulate a cross-fade depending on the genre of music. The choice is unaffected by this. However, you should utilize the "Fade In" slider if you're employing an audio effect in a video.

### Method 3: Utilize a File Editor

Using the File Editor to modify is another method for fading in Logic Pro X. This technique records audio data directly. If you're manipulating a single audio sample or area without bouncing, this is helpful. Simply choose the "Fade Out" option from the track menu to alter an audio area. To adjust the fade-out area throughout this procedure, you will need to move the playhead back and forth.

Step1 Either hit the E key or click the icon of a button with a pair of scissors in the top left corner of your screen. Drag the start of your fade from where you want it to start on your waveform to where you want it to stop. Choose File from the menu.

## Conclusion

Apple's Logic Pro X is not compatible with Windows-based computers. Therefore, if you want the Logic Pro experience on Windows and Mac as well, you have [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as an alternate choice. Everything in the suite, including various effects and composition tools, is included. In conclusion, Filmora is highly feature-rich and enables you to carry out a range of activities, such as crossfading, composition, recording, editing, mixing, and posting to social media sites. Therefore, Filmora is your best option if you want to completely experience a DAW on Windows and Mac.
