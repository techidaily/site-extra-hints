* If they crash, they are going to suffer minimum damage and will keep the situation out of trouble.
* Nano drones possess overall weight of nine ounces so users need not to follow the formalities to register them with FAA.
* They take very less time to charge as they hold smaller battery units.
**Cons**

* Mini drones are not able to ensure rich quality of recorded footage; you might have to make few compromises regarding resolution level and footage stability.
* These devices are equipped with very small batteries due to their compact size so they are able to spend less time in air as batteries get discharged fast.
