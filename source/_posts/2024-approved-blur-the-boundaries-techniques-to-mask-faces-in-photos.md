With an expansive selection of powerful editing tools, Filmora is one of the most popular video editing software on the market.

Step 1: Go to <https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html> and download the Filmora program. Install the program on your PC and open it.

Step 2: Import the video you would like to edit into Filmora by clicking on File and then selecting the Import media option. Now, choose Import Media Files and select the video file you want to edit. Click open. You can also drag and drop the video file into the Media Library.

Step 3: Drag and drop the video onto the timeline.

![pixelate face with Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/pixelate-face-10.png)

Step 6: Drag to the timeline above the footage you are working on. You'll see a small blurred area in the middle of your preview screen.

Step 7: Before adjusting anything, you need to lock your main tracks; this will ensure that you cannot accidentally move them.

Step 8: Click the small blurred area to highlight the blurred mosaic layer. You can now reshape, resize, and move it to the face that you want to pixelate.

Step 9: Click on the blurred mosaic layer and go to the upper left side of your screen, where you'll see that you have some options that allow you to adjust your blur effect.

Step 10: You'll see six different Mosaics that you can choose from; select the pixelated option. Choosing this option will immediately pixelate the face with the mosaic layer.
