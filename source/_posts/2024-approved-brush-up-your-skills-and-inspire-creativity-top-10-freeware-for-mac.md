Considering the above, we have compiled a list of some **free drawing software for Mac** that you can use as a beginner or a professional graphic designer.

Next, click the **Border Color** and **Fill Color** icons and select your preferred colors for the shape’s outline and background color.

Step 3: Use the Text Tool

Click the **Text** tool from the **Markup Toolbar**, drag the text frame to your preferred location on the image, and use the scaling handles to resize the frame. Next, click inside the frame, delete the placeholder text, and type a new caption instead. Now, click the **Text Style** icon, and use the available options to format the text as needed.
