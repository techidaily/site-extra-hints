Mojang Studios' creation, Minecraft, has amassed a ton of popularity. It is known as the Sandbox video game because it takes place in a sandbox-like setting. Since Minecraft is available on a variety of consoles, each zoom in on Minecraft’s functionality may vary significantly. The video game Minecraft has a large following throughout the globe. Most gamers are aware that in order to construct your ideal Minecraft environment, you must gather several materials and employ them. While doing this, you must safeguard your base from intruders and gather all the fresh materials necessary to design and populate your planet as you see fit. You may perform zoom in Minecraft windows 10 by using the following instructions to zoom in. But if this option is there in the version you're using, it will often be found in the "Options" or "Settings" menu, tucked away in the "Video" sub-menu (or the platform equivalent). A slider or other method of changing the value will be included.

Since its first release in 2011, this amazing game has gained an estimated 126 million active players. Many members of the Minecraft gaming community have recently expressed a desire to learn how to zoom in Minecraft launcher. You must crush the item in order to create the intricate parts. Additionally, you must zoom in so that you can appropriately position the supplies in the various scenarios. In the same way, the game demands you to mine resources and utilize them to build the worlds of your choosing from scratch, protect your base from adversaries, and look for newer components to use for your planet. You may want to zoom in on certain areas to utilize blocks and tools more effectively since it entails destroying things and making even more complicated products. If you have the same questions, relax; here is all you need to know to zoom in on Minecraft.

## Way 1\. Change FOV in Options

Although the PC version of Minecraft doesn't come with a built-in zoom in or out feature, you may change the field of view to suit your tastes. A higher field of view setting will allow you to see more in a single frame, but everything will look a little bit smaller. A zoomed-in display is possible by lowering the field of vision and limiting the number of objects you can see.

Step1 To access the in-game menu, launch a game and hit the Esc key on your keyboard.

Step2 In the game menu, choose the Options... button.

![minecraft game menu options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/minecraft-game-menu-options.jpg)

Step3 Now, use the slider to alter your range of vision. The slider will be positioned in the center by default. To get a closer look at your surroundings, click on it and move it to the left of your screen. However, moving the FOV slider all the way to the left also means that you won't be able to see as much during gameplay.

Step4 To save the new FOV settings after finishing adjusting the slider and being satisfied with the field of vision, click Done at the bottom of the page.

Step5 Now, after the successful zoom in on Minecraft, press Backspace to get into the menu and to continue playing, choose "Return to Game."
