## 3. What is the best VLC version to download on Mac?

All MacOS system users need to pay attention here. Many people complain that the version of VLC that they downloaded off the internet is not functioning properly on their Mac. There is a reason behind its bleak performance.

● For Mac OS X 10.3 Panther, the VLC 0.8.6i should be used.
