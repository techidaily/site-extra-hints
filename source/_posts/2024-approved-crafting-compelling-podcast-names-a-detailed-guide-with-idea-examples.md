When choosing a podcast name, it would be best to keep your target audience in mind. What phrase is popular among them? What kind of tone would make your podcast name attract them? Etc. You should do thorough research and find out what your audience likes. Thus, it will help you decide on a podcast name your audience can relate to.

Having a searchable podcast name is very smart, and you can do so by incorporating keywords related to the theme of your show into your podcast name.
