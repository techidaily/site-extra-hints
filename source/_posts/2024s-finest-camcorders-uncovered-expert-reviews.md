There are no limits in recording time with camcorders, which makes it ideal for event photography. Camcorders can be plugged into the socket to continue with videography when batteries are exhausted and have dedicated dials for adjusting volume levels. Therefore, camcorders are a better and worthy purchase.

## Part 2: FAQ for Camcorder

One of the biggest reasons for buying camcorders is the lens. With DSLRs and mirrorless cameras coming to the forefront, people doubt the credibility of a camcorder. But camcorders have powerful and long zoom lenses with tiny imaging sensors, which makes it more powerful than any DSLR. It also comes with variable speed zoom control that can create smooth, slow zooms to reveal and introduce a location, or quick punch-ins to highlight the action. There are no limits in recording time with camcorders, which makes it ideal for event photography. Camcorders can be plugged into the socket to continue with videography when batteries are exhausted and have dedicated dials for adjusting volume levels. Therefore, camcorders are a better and worthy purchase.
