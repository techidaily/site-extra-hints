JahShaka is an open-source video editor that’s in alpha so it does have many crashes. It does have real-time effects and rendering. It’s in full development so for the time being you do need to deal with a lack of features. But it is really cool to use and it does manage to bring in front some interesting options as a whole.

## Conclusion

All these great video editors are worth a try right away. If you do want high standard video editing with great features and a stable application, the tool that stands out is **Wondershare Filmora**. But there are many others to be had here, all you need is to check out the app and you will be amazed at its features!
