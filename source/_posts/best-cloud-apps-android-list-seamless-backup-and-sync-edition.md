**Q1: Which cloud has the most storage space available?**

Google Drive. Google Drive is the most popular **app for cloud storage** platform, and it has more than a billion users all over the world. It's the most well-known cloud storage option and among the best regarding huge files.

**Q2: How can I receive a free cloud space of 2 terabytes?**

pCloud is one of the most excellent free cloud storage alternatives available, with a storage capacity of 2 terabytes (TB). It stands out due to its unlimited remote upload traffic function. It gives its basic accounts a free storage capacity of 10 GB worth of space to use.

## Conclusion

Thus, I hope you are familiar with the concept of **cloud storage apps** at this point. In earlier times, only a tiny percentage of the population used storage on the cloud; however, with the fast-changing world, the youngest to the oldest have become more comfortable with virtual data. So, pick up any of the above **free storage apps** and start your creative journey today.
