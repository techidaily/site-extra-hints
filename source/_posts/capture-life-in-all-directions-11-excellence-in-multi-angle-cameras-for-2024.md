## Part 1: Difference Between Bridge Camera and DSLRs

You can focus on two major differences when it comes to DSLRs and bridge cameras. In a few mirrorless cameras or DSLR models, the one-inch sensor is used, and the rest are bigger than that while the [bridge cameras have smaller sensors](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/2910661). If you are looking for similar picture quality as DSLRs at affordable prices, you may choose for bridge cameras.

Secondly, you can find built-in lenses that are non-removable in bridge cameras, whereas DSLR gives you the option to change lenses. The bridge cams offer wide-ranging subjects and features, but you cannot swap to the fast prime lens or a [super wide-angle lens](https://www.digitalphotomentor.com/5-mistakes-beginners-make-using-a-wide-angle-lens-and-how-to-avoid-them/) for low-light photography or change to a macro lens for close-up pictures.

Viewfinder Type – Electronic

After FZ200 in 2012, Panasonic has come up with the Lumix FZ300\. There are similar features in FZ300 carried forward from its last version. It includes the 24x zoom lens with a constant f/2.8 aperture and the 12.1-megapixel sensor. The Panasonic FZ300 has many more advanced features apart from the older features from its older version. It is an appealing choice for photographers looking for a long-zoom best bridge camera.

**Pros**\-

* Constant f/2.8 max aperture
* Fast, wide-angle 24x zoom provides good overall optical performance for its type
* Generally good image quality for such a small sensor
* Very close macro mode
* Very low prefocused shutter lag
* RAW and RAW+JPEG file support

**Cons**\-

* Limited dynamic range and poor high ISO performance compared to cameras with larger sensors
* Soft corners at some focal lengths even stopped-down
* Strong distortion correction at wide-angle (typical)
* Default noise reduction is a little heavy-handed (though NR can be adjusted)
* Area-specific noise reduction can lead to rough edges and other artifacts
* JPEG colors could be better
* Clunky menu system
