## No. 5 VoiceX Voice Changer \[Extension\]

VoiceX is a **voice changer extension** for **Chrome** that can be used to change your voice in real time. You can even change your voice pitch. It's a fairly simple extension: select your desired voice from the drop-down menu and start talking. The extension will then change your voice to match the chosen voice.

VoiceX worked well for the most part. It sounded natural, and there was very little lag. However, we did encounter some issues with the extension crashing on occasion. Overall, we were impressed with VoiceX and would recommend it to anyone looking for a **voice changer for Chromebook**.

 Pros

* Easy to use
* Works for any browser app you can talk in
* Real-time voice changer
* Good quality outcome

 Cons

* Very few voice effect options

How to install and use VoiceX **Voice Changer Extension for Chromebook**:

Step1 Add the VoiceX Voice Changer extension to your Chrome from the Chrome web store.
