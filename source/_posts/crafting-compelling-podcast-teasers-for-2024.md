### 1\. Asking Questions at the start

It would be best to start the podcast trailer by asking some questions. This is an excellent choice to build up the audience's interest in your podcast.

### 2\. A clear introduction

A good podcast trailer should introduce you and your podcast with its exciting points and releasing date. Keep it short because viewers might lose attention if you make it lengthy.
