## 2\. Widerun virtual biking

You will surely be reluctant to get off the bike is you can bike in these cool sites virtually! It is a fascinating concept to try out even once in a lifetime. But it can be an addiction also. This is the virtual reality and the augmented reality in its best form! Good work was done by Widerun!

## Why we need VR bikes?

Exercise is the most important part of our life as anything else. Workout makes the person healthy. But it is not easy for anyone to make this habit a permanent part of life. Because it needs too much consistency and effort. Going out for running every morning is obviously not a very simple task for anyone. And also joining the gym is also not a simple task it takes commitment. But if we not work out daily and keep laying all the day in the bed or just pass the day sitting in the office, it will cause dangerous side effects to the health.

So, in order cater, this problem, scientist, and developers of virtual reality concept have improvised the way of exercising and have taken this to the next level. The invention of virtual reality bikes has changed the way of exercising. Now you can enjoy the bike ride at any location in the world and enjoy as well.
