## Conclusion

While these eight apps will serve you very well for editing collages on your phone, they do have limitations. If you want to create the perfect video collage for a special moment, you will have an easier time using a desktop computer. Here I would like to recommend Filmora. It is a program you can use on your computer to create the perfect video collage with powerful editing tools. Try it for FREE.
