#### Do Not Zoom In/Out

 As already mentioned earlier, in Android photography the digital zoom feature is not really worth it. Cropping a photo is far better an option than zooming in. Try to step closer to your subject, if you want to get a clear picture of it. If your cannot, then focus on your subject and click to crop it later. The digital zooming feature cannot be the solution to a clear picture.

#### Use HDR Effect

 The default camera apps include the HDR feature in the iOS and Android devices. The HDR or the high definition range is a filter that can be used as and when required. Get the HDR toggle on both the OSes, just on the shutter screen itself. The HDR in the Android photography keeps the balance between the dark and the light parts of your image. Keep the phone steady as it requires a long exposure.

#### Cleaning the Lens is Important

 In Android photography second important thing to keep in mind is cleaning the lens of the device. Your mobile phone spends a lot of time in your pocket or in your hands. Your fingerprints and dust can conceal the lens of your Android phone obstructing a clear image while clicking. A grime filled lens tend to block the entry of light, resulting in cloudy and vague images. Use a cleaning solution and a microfiber cloth to clean the lens of your device for a crystal clear image using your Android phone.

## 6 Tips for Amazing Android Photography

#### It is Always Light

 While Android photography, it is important that your subject faces the light. Many Android phone cameras do not have the flash option. In such a case, if the subject is at the back of the light and you are facing light then the subject will appear dark. Unless a silhouette shot, you need not face the light, let your subject face it.

![light](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lighting-equipment04.JPG)

#### The Rule of Thirds

 What is the rule of thirds? It is a compositional gridline to guide the inexperienced in photography and painting. It helps in taking photos by creating grids and dividing the photo into nine equal parts. The photos are better and interesting when the subjects astride the imaginary lines dividing the photograph into 2 vertical and 2 horizontal guide lines. For a more balanced image, ensure that the subject is slightly of the centre.

![rule of third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rule-of-third.jpg)

#### Change Your Focus

 What is your subject? While clicking photos, your camera cannot track your subject by Auto focussing option. So to ensure a flawless photo, it is essential that you touch your finger on the screen to focus manually. You just need to touch right on your subject to set your focus completely.
