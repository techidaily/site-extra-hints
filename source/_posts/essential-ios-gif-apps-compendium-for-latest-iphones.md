#### 8\. GIF X ![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-editor-gif-art-creator.jpg)

Even though the free version of this GIF app for iPhone provides more than enough features to create awesome GIFs, removing the watermark or unlocking all features must be paid for. GIF X provides over 300 effects that can be applied to videos and photos and more than 200 masks that can be used to customize GIF effects. Adding music to GIFs is another remarkable feature offered by the GIF X app, but you must import the photos and videos from your camera roll or download them from GIPHY.

Each GIF created with GifLab can be converted to video and shared on Instagram or easily shared anywhere else on the Internet. This GIF app for iPhone lets you add captions, apply filters and choose the speed and the quality of a GIF, but it doesn't provide any tools for capturing photos or videos.

#### 10\. PicsArt GIF & Sticker Maker ![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gifart-gif-maker.jpg)

The list of features provided by this iPhone GIF maker is stunning since a quick look at it leaves you wondering if there is anything this app can't do. Its users can use any kind of media to create their GIFs and what's more PicsArt GIF & Sticker Maker offers a long list of GIF effects and animated masks.

The huge library of fonts makes adding text or captions to GIFs a lot of fun and it contributes to a strong impression this app leaves on all of its users.

### Frequently Asked Questions About GIF Apps for iPhone

#### 1\. Can I Make Animated GIFs With iPhoneâ€™s Photos App?

Even though the Live Photos feature that is available in the iPhoneâ€™s native Photos app enables you to create image loops, you wonâ€™t be able to create a real GIF on iPhone without a GIF creator.

Luckily there are a lot of apps in the App Store you can use for free that allows you to create animated GIFs. Whatâ€™s more, you can use these apps to convert live photos youâ€™ve taken with your iPhone into GIFs and share them on non-Apple devices.

#### 2\. How to Turn Photos Into Animated Gifs on iPhone?

The only way to turn a series of photos into an animated GIF on the iPhone is to install a GIF creator app. Once youâ€™ve gone through the installation process, you just have to upload the photos you want to include in the GIF, add text or apply visual effects and set the loop count value.

The export options vary from one GIF app to the other, but most GIF creators that are compatible with iOS devices allow you to choose the quality of the GIF youâ€™re exporting or allow you to save your GIFs as videos.

However, if you want to make a GIF online, [Filmora meme maker](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is your ultimate solution.
