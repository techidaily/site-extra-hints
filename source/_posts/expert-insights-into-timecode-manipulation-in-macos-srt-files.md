## Part 3: The Best Way to Edit .SRT Files for Videos on Mac

While all of the solutions given in Part 2 allow you to access SRT files on Mac, the editing benefits are limited. Instead, you can opt for an efficient video editing software like Filmora if you are wondering **how to create SRT file on Mac** and then edit it. The software supports SRT files for viewing, formatting, editing, and more.

**What is Filmora?**

The software comes with various standard-level and advanced editing functions, including speech-to-text for voiceover-based transcriptions into the video. Moreover, you can use the preset effects, including Boris FX/NewBlue FX (on certain Mac devices only), to further optimize video quality. Not only the video, but you can also edit the audio playback, voiceovers, and edit SRT files here.
