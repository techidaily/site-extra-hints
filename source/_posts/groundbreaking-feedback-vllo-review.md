This allows users to create unique and professional-looking videos with ease. Additionally, the app's built-in music library offers 200+ royalty-free music and sound effects, while the stickers and text library include 2000+ content for your video editing.

Some other advantages of the VLLO app include the ability to add sound effects, voiceovers, frames, templates, ramping effects, and animations or freeze, reverse, or blur the video with such a few taps.

Furthermore, the app offers an export option, which lets you share your content with the world. During the export process, you can also set the Frame rate and Resolution of your videos to get a higher quality clip.

**Disadvantages:**

Some VLLO app users complain that whenever they try to edit or export large files, the app crashes, making them lose all their content. Moreover, there is no built-in camera within the app, and most of the filters, music, stickers, effects, and other advanced tools are available only for premium users.

## Part 5\. Best VLLO Video Editor Alternative on Desktop

Unfortunately, mobile devices don't have the same processing power as desktop computers. This is why desktop video editing software is better, as it can handle more complex tasks and create better results. Mobile video editing apps are often more limited in features and functionality. They also tend to be more difficult to use since the smaller screen size makes it harder to see the details of your work.
