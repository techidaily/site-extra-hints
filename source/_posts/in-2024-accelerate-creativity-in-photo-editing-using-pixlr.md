### 9\. Add Effects and Overlays

If you find your image still boring even after adding all the elements, borders, stickers, and drawings, you can apply high-quality effects and overlays to the images within no time.

Through a healing tool, you can remove the flaws by pointing out the spots to be precise and accurate.
