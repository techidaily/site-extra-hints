 Drone racing has really taken hold over the past few years and has become somewhat of a sport. As well as the flying experience the Walkera F210 captures great videos of the race and it's pretty much ready to fly as it's assembled in the box. It's extremely responsive, built robust in case of crashing, responsive and best of all fast. The camera is not only great in daylight, but also has night vision so that you can up your race when the sun goes down.
