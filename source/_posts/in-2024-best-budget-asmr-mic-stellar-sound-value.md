![detach audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/asmr-microphones-13.jpg)

Step4Next right-click on the detached audio. A page showing several editing features will pop up at the top left corner of your screen just as shown below:

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958379/18409" target="_top" id="1958379"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958379" border="0" alt="" width="856" height="508"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958379/18409" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![editing features](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/asmr-microphones-14.jpg)

Scroll down to where you have the **Denoise** option, and check the **Remove background noise** option. Click on **OK**, and Filmora will immediately delete the background noise from the audio. Now you can export the video to your local drive. To do that click on the **Export** icon.

## FAQs

#### Q1\. What's the best polar pattern for ASMR microphones?

Having an ASMR microphone with multiple polar patterns is great but if you have the one with just a cardioid polar pattern that's cool. With a cardioid polar pattern mic, you can capture your voice without any background noise. We listed some microphones with only cardioid polar patterns in the article above. Check them out.

#### Q2\. How to choose the best ASMR Microphone?

Selecting the best ASMR microphone isn't easy, but here are some important factors to look out for to make the best decision:

* Affordability
* Polar Pattern
* Sensitivity
* Power source
* Condenser/Dynamic (Condenser is a better option)
