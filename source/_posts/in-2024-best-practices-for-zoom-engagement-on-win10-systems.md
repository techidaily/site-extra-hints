## Part 1\. How to Download Zoom Desktop Client

A popular trend, particularly in the last two years, is working from home. Although the Basic plan that is free has a 40-minute time restriction on group meetings, Zoom is accessible for download for free. However, you are permitted to hold an infinite number of one-on-one meetings and group meetings with up to 100 participants. If you want more, you may upgrade to the Pro plan, which raises the 24-hour meeting time limit and adds admin controls and features like a personalized meeting ID and user management.

**Steps to Download Zoom Desktop Client:**

As we are all aware, Zoom allows us to host meetings, attend lectures, and see webinars. As opposed to conventional offices and schools, Zoom also makes it feasible and simpler to capture a screen during a conference. It is important to understand how to download it because of this.

Step1Launch the web browser on your computer and go to Zoom.us to access the Zoom website. In the website's footer, at the bottom of the page, click Download tab and the options are visible as follows:
