An online subtitle editor can be an excellent tool for those who want to add subtitles to their videos. However, using them has some drawbacks, such as instability and glitches.

Luckily, the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) desktop subtitle editor is a perfect option for those who want to create subtitles and return to the video file later to resume and finish the work. The editor also offers a one-click speech-to-text feature, and you can change your font style and color or apply animations.
