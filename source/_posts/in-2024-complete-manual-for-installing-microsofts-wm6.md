## Part 5\. Pros and Cons of Movie Maker 6.0

Microsoft's popular and user-friendly movie editor is called Windows Movie Maker. With Movie Maker 6.0, you may import recorded TV episodes into WMM, cut out the commercials, trim the beginning and conclusion, and then resave the program in a more space-saving format like WMV to your hard drive, copy it to DVD, or even distribute it over the Internet. Here are some other Pros and Cons:

 Pros

* Use images or other videos to make your own movies or animations.
* Adding music from our music collection or downloading it from web sources is an option.
* Drag and drop the frames of a video into a timeline to change their order.
* Adjust the volume of any narrations, music, or videos.
* Your works may be saved locally, uploaded to the cloud, or emailed.
* Record audio narrators from a microphone and video from a webcam.
* Include visual transitions, captions, and image effects. You may also include opening or closing credits that include the actors, the director, the setting, or the OST composer.

 Cons

* The program often hangs the whole PC.
* It cannot be removed via the Add/Remove control panel.
* A Windows Movie Maker 6.0 cannot be used for intricate editing.
