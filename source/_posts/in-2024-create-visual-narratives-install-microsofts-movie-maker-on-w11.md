## Create Visual Narratives: Install Microsoft's Movie Maker on W11

Microsoft's video editing tool, movie maker, which debuted 19 years ago, did not find the kind of success Microsoft had hoped for, and as a result, the firm was forced to stop supporting it. In a new video, Microsoft wishes to remind users that a superior alternative to Windows Movie Maker is called Clipchamp. However, the demise of the 19-year-old program opened the door for alternative **movie maker windows 11**, which is included with Windows 11.

The corporation reportedly acquired the editing suite Clipchamp last year, and it is reportedly accessible as an "inbox" app for Windows 11\. It will therefore be pre-installed alongside other applications like Microsoft Family. In Windows 11, Clipchamp is intended to take the place of Windows Movie Maker as a video editing program. A recognizable user interface, including templates, project bins, timeline, and more, is provided by Clipchamp for **Windows movie maker 11**. Styles, stock media, transitions and. Filters are all included in the asset libraries that are supplied.

## Part 1\. Use Clipchamp Video Maker

With the help of Clipchamp, anyone can easily create videos, even those without any prior editing skills. In Windows 10 and Windows 11, you may create videos using the new program Clipchamp. The editing program Clipchamp, which Microsoft purchased last year, is superior to earlier programs like Windows Movie Maker. For work, social networking, or to document significant occasions, you may use Clipchamp on Windows to produce intriguing new films. Let's check how to edit in Clipchamp **windows 11 movie maker.**

## Part 2\. Edit Videos in Windows 11 with Photos App

Windows has always offered methods for searching and displaying photos because it is a relatively flexible operating system. However, with Windows 11, Microsoft tried combining browsing, organizing, and viewing into a single program and some simple editing.

The outcome, the innocently named "Photos" app, can be pretty confusing. You can do anything with your photographs and videos, thanks to the Photos experience. Compare, edit, view, construct albums and create movies with ease of your priceless memories. While keeping you involved in the experience, it displays all of the goods from that place and lets you navigate to other pictures.
