## Innovative Windows Media Cutting Tools

In order to improve its performance, Microsoft continued to make changes to old Windows Movie Maker. Every time there is a new edition, Microsoft adds a bit more functionality and depth to provide the user an interesting experience.

You may consult this guide for further information if you need a more modern service.

The Windows Movie Maker old version has had a ton of options, including music, narration, transition effects, and more.

The initial version was included with Windows Me in 2000, but Windows 2000, which came out months before, did not have it, which is why it was missing from the latter. Industry players didn't really pay much attention to WMM since it didn't provide enough features to compete with its rivals. Microsoft chose to produce version 1.1 after realizing WMM's drawbacks. That version was made available at the same time as the Windows XP OS from Microsoft.

For this, Windows Movie Maker's first port was created. On the right side, a video preview is shown. There is room to add images, music, and other media on the left. The plot may be found at the very bottom. Even with capabilities like file input, live video recording, clip segmentation, clip organization, post-production editing, Windows Media file export functionality, and email sharing ability, the WMM version was still subpar.
