## Features and performance

#### **1. Battery and Storage:**

 Before you start recording with your Edge X camera, ensure that you have charged its battery full. For storing your videos and photos you also need to buy an SD card. The sad part is that camera does not have powerful internal memory; it can just store few photographs or a video of maximum 5 seconds only. While buying a new SD card for your camera, it is good to pick class 10 version otherwise your camera will not support storage. Such cards assists in fast read and write operations.

#### **2. Video and Image Quality:**

 The best thing to know about this advanced action cam is that it supports motion detection. That means recording gets automatically started whenever this device detects any motion around. The wide angle lenses follow automatic fish eye correction and whenever camera is mounted upside down then video easily rotates unto 180 degrees. Users can record with video time lapse mode and can also record lower resolution videos perfectly with dual stream selection. This camera does not have any internal image stabilization facility but it supports filters that can enhance colour information in videos.

#### **4. Self Capture and Burst Modes:**

 If you are a crazy about selfies then your Intova Edge X can assist you better with its burst mode. It assists in shooting stills at 3, 5 and 10 seconds without adding any blur effect to stills.

The app works via a password protected quick start guide and can provide you live view of camera. It is also much easier to transfer files between various devices and you can have a preview over content to edit it as per need before sharing.

## Features and performance

#### **1. Battery and Storage:**

 Before you start recording with your Edge X camera, ensure that you have charged its battery full. For storing your videos and photos you also need to buy an SD card. The sad part is that camera does not have powerful internal memory; it can just store few photographs or a video of maximum 5 seconds only. While buying a new SD card for your camera, it is good to pick class 10 version otherwise your camera will not support storage. Such cards assists in fast read and write operations.

#### **2. Video and Image Quality:**

 The best thing to know about this advanced action cam is that it supports motion detection. That means recording gets automatically started whenever this device detects any motion around. The wide angle lenses follow automatic fish eye correction and whenever camera is mounted upside down then video easily rotates unto 180 degrees. Users can record with video time lapse mode and can also record lower resolution videos perfectly with dual stream selection. This camera does not have any internal image stabilization facility but it supports filters that can enhance colour information in videos.
