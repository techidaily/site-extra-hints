The video compression level can be also adjusted with ease by choosing high bit rates or normal mode.

 It is possible to record footage with Ghost S in high bit rate as well as in normal mode. The still quality is 12MP that offers crystal clear views.

The video compression level can be also adjusted with ease by choosing high bit rates or normal mode.

 It is possible to record footage with Ghost S in high bit rate as well as in normal mode. The still quality is 12MP that offers crystal clear views. When you use normal bit rate at 1080p then edges of videos appear jagged and interlaced. But this issue can be slightly resolved with high bit rate settings.
