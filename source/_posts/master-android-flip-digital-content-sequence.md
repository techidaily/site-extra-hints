## Part 4: How to Reverse video with VN on Android?

VN Video Editor, also known as VN Video Editor Maker VlogNow, is a multimedia tool for editing video material on your Android smartphone or tablet. The version is free for use, with no watermarks or other restrictions, and is said to be highly effective in a variety of editing tasks for several of today's streaming video demands.

The editing functions themselves are essential enough but not very sturdy. The transitioning is also nicer than what you'll get on many free applications, but certainly a step less than you'll get on more significant NLE sites. VN Video Editor is best suited for editing footage shot straight from your phone (but not in-app). The textual and subtitle options are ideal for creating material for TikTok or YouTube.

To play a reverse video with VN Video Editor on Android, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Download and install VN and launch it on your Android phone.

**Step 2:** Click on the **+** icon from the bottom and tap **New Project.**

**Step 3:** Navigate the video you wish to reverse and select it by tapping it and upload it by pressing the **blue ->** button in the right corner.

**Step 4:** Now slide towards the right and click on **Reverse** from the bottom menu.

**Step 1:** Launch the PowerDirector Video Editor app on your phone after downloading and installing it.

**Step 2:** Create a new project by clicking on **New Project** and upload the video you wish to reverse,
