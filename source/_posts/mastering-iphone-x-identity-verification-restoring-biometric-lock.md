If this process of rebooting doesn't work, then try the force rebooting option by pressing the volume up button first, releasing it, and then again follow the same with the volume down button and releasing it. Finally, press the side button and keep holding it until the Apple logo appears on the iPhone X screen.

#### Make sure you are Directly Facing TrueDepth

Are you sure your iPhone X is in a portrait angle? It is very important to ensure while using iPhone X that your face is directed towards the TrueDepth camera, and it's in portrait orientation. The true depth cam has the same view range as while taking selfies or while making facetime calls. Your iPhone X must be within an arm's length from your face while unlocking with face id. If you are out with your iPhone on broad daylight, make sure that the sun is not just behind you.

#### Reset All Settings

When the face id fails to recognize you while unlocking your iPhone X device, you may try to reset all the settings. When you do this, it doesn't lose any of your data but reset your device to the iPhone's default setting. The problems like wi-fi disconnection and others are often solved by resetting all the settings in iPhone X. In order to reset, got to settings, then general, next reset, and finally reset all settings.
