1. Customize the size and position of your video within the frame to achieve a perfect fit.
2. Adjust your video's duration, speed, or orientation as needed to create the desired visual impact.
3. Optionally, incorporate additional effects or text overlays to enhance the video's appeal.

Once you've achieved the desired look for your Picture Frame Video, it's time to export your creation:

1. Click on the **"Export"** button within Filmora.
2. Select your preferred export settings, such as resolution and format.
