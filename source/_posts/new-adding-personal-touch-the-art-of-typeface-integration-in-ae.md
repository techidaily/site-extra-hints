With the high demand for video consumption across the world, video editing has become a necessary task for most users. Even persons with general needs such as classes, presentations, meetings, etc. would need a video editor to complete their video project. A

One of such major functions of After Effects is it provides different fonts and text effects to its users. Here's a guide on **how to add fonts to After Effects**:

## Part 1\. How to add fonts to After Effects?

Adding fonts to any video editor is a crucial part because texts add a story to the video projects. They have a great impact on the cinematic quality of any video. For informative videos, the style of font decides the tone in which the texts are displayed.

Thus, selecting a proper font for the video becomes necessary in the post-production process. In the After Effects application, there are different fonts available for the users to load and use in any video. And if you are wondering **how to add font in After effects** to your video, then you can follow these steps:

## Part 2\. Types of Fonts in After Effects

Adobe After Effects provides a ton of families of fonts that can be added and used in video projects. These fonts are available on the Create Cloud application and also on the official website of adobe. Also, these fonts are categorized according to their height, weight, contrast as well as other attributes.

Some of the most famous fonts such as "typewriter", "Cursive Handwriting" and many more are categorized under their family of fonts and are very easy to access. Along with this, you can also select fonts with different character strokes and can alter their features while adding to your videos.

## Part 3\. How to use text effects in After Effects?
