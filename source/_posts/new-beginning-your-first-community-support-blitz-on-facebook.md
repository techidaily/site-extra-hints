## Beginning Your First Community Support Blitz on Facebook

So, you want to run a giveaway on your Facebook page? That's a great idea! Giveaways are a great way to engage with your fans and followers, and they can also help to promote your business. But before you start posting about your giveaway, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. Here are some tips for running a successful Facebook giveaway.

## Part 1\. Choose a giveaway prize that is relevant to your target audience

![choose giveaway prize for facebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/choose-giveaway-prize-for-facebook.jpg)

When it comes to choosing a giveaway prize, relevant is always the best way to go. First, consider your target audience. What would they be interested in? A coffee mug with your company logo may be great for some, but if you're targeting outdoorsy types, they might prefer a hiking hat or water bottle.

Really think about what your target audience would find useful or fun, and choose a prize accordingly. It'll make them more likely to enter the giveaway, and more likely to remember your brand down the line. Plus, it'll show that you're tuned into their interests - always a plus in the eyes of potential customers. So, when you're planning your next giveaway, keep relevance front and center, and you'll be sure to choose a winner.

## Part 2\. Make sure the giveaway is compliant with Facebook's rules

![facebook rules for giveaway](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/facebook-rules-for-giveaway.jpg)

When hosting a giveaway on Facebook, it's important to make sure that you are compliant with their rules. Otherwise, your giveaway could be shut down and you could be at risk of being banned from the platform. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* You must use a third-party app to host your giveaway. Facebook does not allow giveaways to be hosted directly on its platform.
* Your giveaway must have clearly defined rules. For example, you will need to specify how winners will be chosen and what the prize is.
* You are responsible for ensuring that your giveaway is fair and legal. This means making sure that there is no purchase necessary to enter and that the prize is not illegal or restricted in any way.
* Make sure you promote your giveaway in a way that complies with Facebook's advertising policies. For example, you cannot include false or misleading information in your posts about the giveaway.

Following these guidelines will help to ensure that your Facebook giveaway is successful and compliant with the platform's rules.

## Part 3\. Promote your giveaway on other channels, such as your website and email list

![prompt facebook giveaway activity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/prompt-facebook-giveaway-activity.jpg)

A giveaway is a great way to generate buzz and interest in your product or service. But how do you make sure that people actually see your giveaway? One of the best ways is to promote it on other channels, such as your website or email list. This ensures that your target audience is aware of the giveaway and has a chance to enter.

Additionally, you can use social media to spread the word about your giveaway. By sharing it with your followers and tagging relevant hashtags, you can reach a wider audience and increase the chances of someone taking notice. With a little effort, you can make sure that your next giveaway is a success.

## Part 4\. Set a deadline for entering the giveaway

![set deadline for facebook giveaway](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/set-deadline-for-facebook-giveaway.jpg)

The best way to ensure that your giveaway is successful is to set a deadline for entering. This will help to create a sense of urgency and encourage people to action. It's also important to be clear about what the deadline is.

For example, if you're giving away a prize every day, make sure to specify that entrants must submit their entry by 11:59 PM on the day of the drawing. Finally, don't forget to promote the deadline! Make sure that your social media posts and emails include information about when the giveaway ends.

By taking these simple steps, you can make sure that your giveaway runs smoothly and meets your goals.

## Part 5\. Choose a winner randomly from among all entrants

![choose winner for facebook entrants](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/choose-winner-for-facebook-entrants.jpg)

Random selection is a fair and unbiased way to choose a winner, and it's easy to do! There are a few different methods you can use to select a random winner.

* The first is to put all of the entrants' names into a hat and draw one out.
* Another option is to generate a random number using a random number generator website or app - simply set the range from 1 to the number of entrants, and voila! You have your winner.
* A third option is to lay all of the entrants' names out on a piece of paper or spreadsheet, and then use a random number generator to select which name corresponds to which number.

Whichever method you choose, selecting a winner randomly is the best way to ensure that the contest is fair.

## Part 6\. Contact the winner and get them to provide shipping information

![contact winner to shipment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/contact-winner-to-shipment.jpg)

Now that you've chosen a winner for your contest, it's time to get their shipping information so you can send them their prize! The good news is that collecting this information is easy - all you need to do is contact the winner and ask for it.

There are a few different ways you can contact the winner. The simplest method is to post a message on the contest page, tagging the winner in the post. This will ensure that they see your message and can respond quickly. You can also send them a direct message if you have their contact information. If not, you can always email them or give them a call.

Once you've got in touch with the winner, just let them know what prize they've won and ask for their shipping address. Most people are happy to provide this information, and it shouldn't take more than a few minutes to collect everything you need. Then you can ship off the prize and everyone will be happy!

## Part 7\. Ship the prize to the winner

![ship the prize to the-winner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/ship-the-prize-to-the-winner.jpg)

The next step after gathering a winner's shipping information is to, of course, ship their prizes. This can seem like a daunting task, but it doesn't have to be! The key is to stay organized and take it one step at a time.

Step1 First, you'll want to gather all of the items that the winner will be receiving. Make sure you have everything they're expecting, and double-check that it's all in good condition.

Step2 Once you have everything gathered up, it's time to start packing. If you're shipping multiple items, it's a good idea to package them together so they arrive safely.

Step3 Once everything is packed up and ready to go, it's time to print out the shipping label. Be sure to include all of the necessary information, such as the recipient's name and address.

Step4 Once the label is printed out, simply attach it to the package and drop it off at your local post office. And that's it!

By following these simple steps, you can easily ship prizes to winners without any hassle.

## Part 8\. Announce the winner on your Facebook page

![announce winner on facebook page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/announce-winner-on-facebook-page.jpg)

It's time to announce the winners of your latest contest! Make sure to post about it on your Facebook page, and encourage the winners to post a picture with their prize mentioning your page. This is a great way to spread the word about your business and get more people interested in what you have to offer. Plus, it's always nice to give your customers a little extra something to show how much you appreciate their support.

So, go ahead and announce those winners - they're sure to be thrilled, and you're sure to see an uptick in traffic and interest in no time. Thanks for playing!

## Part 9\. Run additional giveaways to keep your fans engaged

![run additional giveaways on facebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/run-additional-giveaways-on-facebook.jpg)

Running a giveaway is a great way to engage your fans and followers. But did you know that you can also use giveaways to keep your fans engaged? By running additional giveaways, you can keep your fans coming back for more. And the more engaged your fans are, the more likely they are to stick around.

So, if you're looking for a way to keep your fans engaged, consider running additional giveaways. You may be surprised at how well it works.

## Conclusion
