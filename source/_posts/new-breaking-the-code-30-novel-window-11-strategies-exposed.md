### 2\. Minimize Applications

Minimizing Applications allows you to minimize the extra tabs as a whole rather than doing it individually. You have to hold the tab that you are using by left-clicking and shaking it. It will minimize all extra tabs. The same process can be done to restore the minimized windows.

This feature can be activated through Windows Settings and then by clicking on ‘Multi-Tasking.' Switch on the toggle switch next to ‘Title Bar Window Shake,' and it is ready to use.
