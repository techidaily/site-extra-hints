## Bringing Text to Life: 3D Techniques in Illustrator

It takes 10 minutes. Even if you've never used Adobe Illustrator before, you will still need about 10 minutes to create a 3D text effect in Adobe Illustrator. Whatever your reason for creating this effect, you can customize it thoroughly and get a result that completely meets your requirements.

This guide will show you the step-by-step process of creating a 3D text effect in Adobe Illustrator. So, if you're ready, let's begin.

## What You Need to Create a 3D Text Effect in Adobe Illustrator

All you need are ten minutes of your time and the Adobe Illustrator application. Oh yes, and you need a little bit of imagination as well. That's all there is to it.

After you get the program, install it and follow the step-by-step instructions you'll see below.

Also, there are plenty of different ways to create 3D text effects in Adobe Illustrator. This tutorial will focus on explaining the easiest and quickest one. Just know that this doesn't mean the result will be wrong. Most methods yield the same results.

## How to Create 3D Text Effects in Adobe Illustrator

Now that you know what you're getting into, let's finally reveal the entire process. Just follow the steps and do as you see here.

Step1 Open the program and start a new project.

Step2 Click on the **Type tool** and click anywhere on your blank canvas. Then, type in your text—type in anything you want.

![type tool illustrator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-illustrator-type-tool.png)

Step3 Now, look at the bottom-right corner of the program. Find the **Font** settings and change your font type and size to anything you want.

![change font illustrator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-illustrator-font.png)

Step4 Next, choose any color you want for your text from the panel on the screen's left side. Just remember to click on your text first before you start changing colors.

![change color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-illustrator-color.png)

Step5 Align the text to make it easier to edit and move around the canvas later. Just click on it and then click on the three buttons in the image below. This section is located at the bottom-right corner of the screen.

Step6 Up next, you need to turn on your 3D Effects panel if it still needs to be activated. To do this, click on **Window** → **3D and Materials.** Then, look at the right side of the screen, and you will see the panel pop up.

Step7 Click on the box icon on the right side of the screen and select **“Extrude”** This will instantly transform your text into a 3D model.

Step8 Now, all left to do is experiment with the settings in this panel and adjust how you want your 3D text to look. You can adjust its width, rotation, presets, angle, perspective, and so on. Just play around with the settings until you find your ideal result.

## Best Alternative Way to Create 3D Text Animation

You might not believe it, but there's an even more accessible and less expensive way to create 3D text effects. You can use [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Compared to Illustrator, Filmora is much better for beginners and more affordable.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

If you're just a beginner at video or photo editing, you want to use a more straightforward tool. Illustrator can get very challenging for complete beginners.

Step1 Download Filmora and run the program. Once it opens, click on **New Project.**

Step2 Head to the **Titles** tab and search for the **“3D Illustration**” title. Then, drag it into the Timeline. You can also find several other 3D titles. If you like another one better, drag that one instead of the one we mentioned here.

![drag title to timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-04.png)

Step3 Double-click on the 3D title layer you dragged into the Timeline. When the settings panel opens, use all the boxes and slide bars to customize your 3D text any way you want. When you’re done customizing it, click on **OK.**

![edit text settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/win-motion-tracking-03.png)

Step4 Finally, import a video in Filmora and drag it under the text into the Timeline. Choose any video or image you want to display underneath your 3D text. That’s it! Hit **Export,** and you’re all done. Congratulations on creating a 3D text effect in Filmora.
