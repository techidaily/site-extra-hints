## Novice's Guide to Photo Enhancements with Photoshop

[Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) is known for its advanced key features and options through which professionals enhance their photos with a few retouches. If the captured photo lacks some requirements or includes flaws, people can easily vanish the flaws through Photoshop effortlessly.
