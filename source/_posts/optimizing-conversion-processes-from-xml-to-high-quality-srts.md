## What does SRT, SSA, XML, etc., look like?

### 1\. SRT

First, there’s a section for subtitle number, which is followed by the time at which the subtitle appears and ends. Then comes the subtitle that will appear.

![subRip subtitle file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-xml-to-srt-19.jpg)

### 2\. SSA

It is a plain text file that is composed of three sections, Script Info, Styles, and Events.

![xml subtitle file appearance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-xml-to-srt-3.jpg)

### 3\. XML

This subtitle format contains encoding, duration, and content of subtitles like this,

Now that we know how to convert SSA subtitle format to SRT format, let’s convert XML format into SRT this time.

Therefore, to convert XML subtitles to SRT, here are the steps you need to follow.

Step1 First of all, go to the [GoTranscript Subtitle Converter](https://gotranscript.com/subtitle-converter).

Step2 Now click on the “Upload” option and select the XML subtitle from your device.

## How to Convert STL to SRT

Made for broadcasting purposes, STL subtitles are a professional type of subtitles that use some special encodings. So most common video players can't support these files and you need to convert them into SRT files that are more of a universal type.

For converting STL subtitles to SRT format, here’s what you need to do.

Step1 Go to the [“STL to SRT Converter”](https://www.converthelper.net/stl-to-srt) from Converthelper.
