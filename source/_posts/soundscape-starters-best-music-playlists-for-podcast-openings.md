## Part 1\. What Kind of Music Can You Use for the Podcast Intro?

Various types of music can be used for podcast intros, including creative common music, royalty-free music, and public domain music. So, whether you're looking to use vocals or special music as an intro for your podcast show, it's crucial you understand these different types of music, as it'll save you from violating copyright laws that could compromise your podcast show's reputation online.

**Creative Common Music (Free to use)**

Creative Common Music is music tracks where the artist gives users 100% freedom to use it without permission. It's a type of music with no copyright. But you might be required to provide credit to the artist. So please read the terms and conditions attached to any creative common music before using it.

**Royalty-Free Music (Paid)**

Royalty-Free Music is the opposite of Creative Common Music. To use such music, you need to have a subscription on the website or make a one-time payment to have 100% right to use it in your podcast intro. In addition, such music is usually subjected to copyright. So, using it without permission will risk your podcast show's reputation.

**Public Domain Music (Free to use)**

Public Domain Music is music with an expired copyright license published in a public domain where you can use them for free without permission or giving credit. For example, in the United States, music works published in 1926 or earlier are Public Domain Music.

You can use tags to look for specific music genres and get a short list of types of music you need for your podcast. However, the Dig CCmixter site is unsecured; it isn't a big concern, but most browsers (depending on your Settings) won't allow you to access the site.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![places to find music for podcast intro stockmusic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/music-for-podcast-intro-4.jpg)

StochMusic has a simple concept, and it sells you music royalty in exchange for a subscription. For as little as US$ 16.69/mo, you can download as many soundtracks as you want for podcast intros. There is another subscription plan which also gives you access to unlimited sound effects besides soundtracks. Soundtracks are suitable for podcast creators looking to add podcast intros.

At the same time, the second plan will be helpful to creators that create story-based podcasts where sound effects add drama to voice and intrigue your users. StockMusic charges money for the music and sound effects because, unlike YouTube Audio Library and Free Music Archive, StockMusic includes music only from professionals. So, the music you get in return for your money is subpar and sounds professional.

**Pros and Cons of StockMusic**

 Pros

* Filter by genre, mood, instruments, duration, and more to search for soundtracks and audio effects.
* Get a license for the music that you purchase on StockMusic and monetize. You can also sell the music to other parties. Transfer the license to someone else via the platform.
* Clean and simple user interface. The site is mobile-responsive, which works well even on mobile devices.

 Cons

* Before downloading music from the site, you must register and subscribe to a plan.

Part 1\. What Kind of Music Can You Use for the Podcast Intro?

Various types of music can be used for podcast intros, including creative common music, royalty-free music, and public domain music. So, whether you're looking to use vocals or special music as an intro for your podcast show, it's crucial you understand these different types of music, as it'll save you from violating copyright laws that could compromise your podcast show's reputation online.

**Creative Common Music (Free to use)**

Creative Common Music is music tracks where the artist gives users 100% freedom to use it without permission. It's a type of music with no copyright. But you might be required to provide credit to the artist. So please read the terms and conditions attached to any creative common music before using it.

**Royalty-Free Music (Paid)**

Royalty-Free Music is the opposite of Creative Common Music. To use such music, you need to have a subscription on the website or make a one-time payment to have 100% right to use it in your podcast intro. In addition, such music is usually subjected to copyright. So, using it without permission will risk your podcast show's reputation.

**Public Domain Music (Free to use)**

Public Domain Music is music with an expired copyright license published in a public domain where you can use them for free without permission or giving credit. For example, in the United States, music works published in 1926 or earlier are Public Domain Music.

* The effect of using copyrighted music in the potential market.
