## Part 2: Prepare Live Streaming With Right Plan

#### 1\. Find Out What You Really Want To Live Stream

When you start out with live streaming of videos, it becomes essential to pick the right topic that can attract viewers. You must be able to understand and choose one particular thing you like to be known about.

Is it the trending games or anything else that people are concentrating more on? You need to find the right subject for your video live streaming in order to make money on Periscope. Once a particular topic is selected, suppose you wish to live stream games, try to analyze which game is the most trending one.

Try to check out the search engines and other gaming sites to find out the games that are the most in news but not yet, saturated. If you are not sure which topic to choose, you may look into gaming communities and forums to see which game is the most focused one.

#### 2\. Consistent Streaming

It is essential to maintain a consistent schedule while publishing content. What does that mean? It means that the time span of the live streaming must be consistent in order to keep your audiences informed. If your audiences have to keep waiting and they are not aware of your posting schedule, they might lose interest and focus.

Suppose you have 3 videos ready and you stream for 3 consecutive days and then disappear for 3 weeks. It gives the wrong message to your audiences. So, it is better to live stream consistently on a weekly basis.

![Consistent Streaming.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Consistent-Streaming.JPG)

#### 3\. Talk to Yourself if You Are Shy

Are you a camera-friendly person? If not, then live streaming can be a quite intimidating task for you, especially if you are shy. Facing the camera and seeing and hearing yourself can be awkward if you are not used to it.

So, try and make it a habit to face the mirror, overlook any flaws that you might be observing, and talk to yourself continuously as much as you can. Increase at least 10-15 seconds with each session of chatting with yourself in the mirror. This will increase your confidence and help you in making yourself comfortable and at ease while you talk.

#### 4\. Make a Script

Having a hard and fast script and narrating or speaking mugged up lines like a school kid can completely ruin your video. So, try to be spontaneous. Keep the points you wish to include in your video handy and refer to it every now and then to have a clear picture of what you would like to say. But, do not make a video as if someone forced you to speak. Be natural and sporty.

But, you make money on Periscope on a regular basis for just sharing the services or products while streaming live. Getting hooked on the big and right brands and companies can earn you handsomely.

## Part 2: Prepare Live Streaming With Right Plan

#### 1\. Find Out What You Really Want To Live Stream

When you start out with live streaming of videos, it becomes essential to pick the right topic that can attract viewers. You must be able to understand and choose one particular thing you like to be known about.

Is it the trending games or anything else that people are concentrating more on? You need to find the right subject for your video live streaming in order to make money on Periscope. Once a particular topic is selected, suppose you wish to live stream games, try to analyze which game is the most trending one.

Try to check out the search engines and other gaming sites to find out the games that are the most in news but not yet, saturated. If you are not sure which topic to choose, you may look into gaming communities and forums to see which game is the most focused one.

#### 2\. Consistent Streaming

It is essential to maintain a consistent schedule while publishing content. What does that mean? It means that the time span of the live streaming must be consistent in order to keep your audiences informed. If your audiences have to keep waiting and they are not aware of your posting schedule, they might lose interest and focus.

Suppose you have 3 videos ready and you stream for 3 consecutive days and then disappear for 3 weeks. It gives the wrong message to your audiences. So, it is better to live stream consistently on a weekly basis.

#### 3\. Talk to Yourself if You Are Shy

Are you a camera-friendly person? If not, then live streaming can be a quite intimidating task for you, especially if you are shy. Facing the camera and seeing and hearing yourself can be awkward if you are not used to it.

So, try and make it a habit to face the mirror, overlook any flaws that you might be observing, and talk to yourself continuously as much as you can. Increase at least 10-15 seconds with each session of chatting with yourself in the mirror. This will increase your confidence and help you in making yourself comfortable and at ease while you talk.

#### 4\. Make a Script

Having a hard and fast script and narrating or speaking mugged up lines like a school kid can completely ruin your video. So, try to be spontaneous. Keep the points you wish to include in your video handy and refer to it every now and then to have a clear picture of what you would like to say. But, do not make a video as if someone forced you to speak. Be natural and sporty.
