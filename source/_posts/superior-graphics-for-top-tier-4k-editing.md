### What are the Most Common Types of Graphics Cards?

There are two common types of graphics cards. Most computers have an **integrated graphics card** that is located on the same chip as the CPU, which enables you to edit photos, watch and edit videos or play video games. However, GPUs and CPUs that are located on the same chip often limit each other’s capabilities, and as a result, the computer needs more time to perform demanding tasks.

Installing a **dedicated graphics card** to your computer will eliminate lagging and it will allow you to edit videos in high resolution faster or reduce the amount of time that is required to render a 4K video. All dedicated graphics cards come with a separate chip and a separate RAM that reduces the strain of a computer’s CPU and minimizes the lagging of the footage during the video editing process.

Whether or not getting a dedicated graphics card will prove to be a good investment depends on the tasks you perform regularly on your computer. If you only edit photos and videos at a basic level, then the integrated graphics card is all you need.

Nonetheless, if you are a professional animator, video editor or simply want to play all the latest games in maximum resolution, a dedicated graphics card is going to make routine tasks you perform on your computer every day much easier and faster.

### Which Factors to Consider While Choosing a Graphics Card?

Currently, there are hundreds of different dedicated graphics card models on the market, and finding the one that is the best fit for your computer’s configuration can take some time and research. Besides checking your computer’s specifications there are a few more aspects you must consider before you purchase a dedicated graphics card.

#### 1\. Power draw

A stable power source is important for all computer configurations, as it helps you avoid system crashes and hardware malfunctions. The power usage of dedicated graphics cards varies from model to model and it can range from just 120 Watts to 300 Watts. In fact, high-end graphics cards consume as much power as all other computer components combined, and you must ensure that your computer’s power supply can provide enough power.

#### 2\. Cooling

Overheating can cause irreparable damage to the graphics card and to your computer, so checking the cooling capabilities of the card you would like to get can help you reduce the risk of failure in the long run. Furthermore, cooling fans on dedicated graphics cards can produce noise, and you must check if the model you’re interested in can operate at low noise levels.

#### 3\. Size

The length of most high-end dedicated graphics cards is between 10.5 and 11-inches, which can occupy two or three expansion slots. That is why you must check how many expansion slots you have at your disposal and check the size of the graphics card before you purchase it.

#### 4\. Multi-card scaling

The available space and the size can also impact your multi-card scaling options, since connecting two or more graphics cards can take a lot of space. AMD and Nvidia can be connected via CrossFire X or NVLink, but pairing graphics cards that have different architectures is not possible.

## Background Information about Graphics Cards

How much time it is going to take to complete a project you shot in 4K, depends on the configuration of the computer you are using to edit the footage. Even though CPU still plays a large role in how smoothly your computer displays the videos in the video editing software, the computer’s GPU can decrease the rendering times or enhance the playback of large 4K files significantly. So, here are some background information on graphics cards.

### What is a Graphics Card?

A graphics card or a video card is a piece of computer hardware that produces the steam of output images you can see on a computer’s monitor or any other display device. All computers feature a graphics card because without them it would be impossible to run even the most basic applications like word processors or web browsers.

### What are the Most Common Types of Graphics Cards?

There are two common types of graphics cards. Most computers have an **integrated graphics card** that is located on the same chip as the CPU, which enables you to edit photos, watch and edit videos or play video games. However, GPUs and CPUs that are located on the same chip often limit each other’s capabilities, and as a result, the computer needs more time to perform demanding tasks.

Installing a **dedicated graphics card** to your computer will eliminate lagging and it will allow you to edit videos in high resolution faster or reduce the amount of time that is required to render a 4K video. All dedicated graphics cards come with a separate chip and a separate RAM that reduces the strain of a computer’s CPU and minimizes the lagging of the footage during the video editing process.

Whether or not getting a dedicated graphics card will prove to be a good investment depends on the tasks you perform regularly on your computer. If you only edit photos and videos at a basic level, then the integrated graphics card is all you need.

Nonetheless, if you are a professional animator, video editor or simply want to play all the latest games in maximum resolution, a dedicated graphics card is going to make routine tasks you perform on your computer every day much easier and faster.

### Which Factors to Consider While Choosing a Graphics Card?

Currently, there are hundreds of different dedicated graphics card models on the market, and finding the one that is the best fit for your computer’s configuration can take some time and research. Besides checking your computer’s specifications there are a few more aspects you must consider before you purchase a dedicated graphics card.

#### 1\. Power draw

A stable power source is important for all computer configurations, as it helps you avoid system crashes and hardware malfunctions. The power usage of dedicated graphics cards varies from model to model and it can range from just 120 Watts to 300 Watts. In fact, high-end graphics cards consume as much power as all other computer components combined, and you must ensure that your computer’s power supply can provide enough power.

#### 2\. Cooling

Overheating can cause irreparable damage to the graphics card and to your computer, so checking the cooling capabilities of the card you would like to get can help you reduce the risk of failure in the long run. Furthermore, cooling fans on dedicated graphics cards can produce noise, and you must check if the model you’re interested in can operate at low noise levels.

#### 3\. Size

The length of most high-end dedicated graphics cards is between 10.5 and 11-inches, which can occupy two or three expansion slots. That is why you must check how many expansion slots you have at your disposal and check the size of the graphics card before you purchase it.

#### 4\. Multi-card scaling

The available space and the size can also impact your multi-card scaling options, since connecting two or more graphics cards can take a lot of space. AMD and Nvidia can be connected via CrossFire X or NVLink, but pairing graphics cards that have different architectures is not possible.
