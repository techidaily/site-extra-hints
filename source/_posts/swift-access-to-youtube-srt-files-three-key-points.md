### Method 3: Get YouTube subtitles as .srt with Reliable Software

The YouTube Studio and Online tools are basic methods for extracting subtitle files but if you are in search of a professional way, we suggest using desktop software. Though an array of these software is available, not all lives up to the tall claims they make. So, to help you with the search, we have shortlisted some decent software in the category.

#### **1\. Wondershare UniConverter**

When it comes to any type of video-related tasks, Wondershare UniConverter is a reliable software around. Compatible with Windows and Mac systems, the software allows extracting the subtitles from YouTube as well as others. The subtitles can be downloaded from videos in all popular formats.

Using the software, you can add the already downloaded YouTube videos or can also use the Downloader function of the tool for downloading YouTube or any other video desired. A wide range of other video editing features is also supported by the software thus making it a complete video toolbox.

#### **2\. DVDVideoSoft**

This is free to use Windows-based tool that allows extracting subtitles from YouTube in SRT as well as TXT format. Subtitles can be extracted from an entire text or also from an interval as desired.
