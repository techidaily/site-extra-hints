#### 2. Design

 Inspire 2 is a large drone unit that is powered with four rotors so that it can stay safe in air. Shell of this drone unit is designed using magnesium alloy that leads to highly durable and light weight design. With its quality design, inspire 2 is capable enough to catch the higher speed ranges that go up to 67 mph and the height limit is again beyond comparison with 16400 feet support above sea level. Its two self heating type batteries make this device safe to fly even in icy temperatures.

#### 3. Battery Life

 It comes with a dual battery slot so that users can connect two powerful battery sources at a time and flight time can be enhanced up to 27 minutes. With this dual battery system, if first TB50 Battery, that is available with price tag of $200, drains completely during flight then second battery gets automatically activated and it can allow safe landing with return to home function. You can charge these batteries with a 180 watt charged and it demands maximum 90 minutes to get fully charged. In case if you wish to charge 4 batteries simultaneously with this intelligent multi charger system then it will take around 180 minutes.

#### 4. Flight Performance

 If we talk about flight performance of Inspire 2 then it must be rated as premium performance with finest controls. You will be glad to know that this drone unit is equipped with advanced sense and avoid system that helps it to stay away from obstacles with a distance range of 30 meters. Further, it allows protected flight with 34mph range and highly controllable attitude angle of 25 degrees. The upward facing sensors made up of infrared technology are able to scan obstacles from 5m distance thus your copter always stays safe in air. This drone can spend maximum 27 minutes in air with powerful dual battery system and its spot light pro mode assists single pilots to track more dramatic and complex images.

 There are two major shooting modes: Composition mode and quick mode. The Quick mode is basic flight mode that allows selection of object and tracking begins. When you take flight with composite mode then you can select the subject as well as its tracking position. Once object enters inside targeted tracking position then a shortcut function can be used to begin tracking. One can make easy adjustments for gimbal position to shoot videos and stills in composite mode.

#### 5. Control Range

 The control unit of DJI Inspire 2 works on two frequency ranges: one is 2.4 GHz and another is 5.8 GHz. It supports Lightbridge technology for effective results and the controllable range goes up to 4.3mi or 7 Km. The controller works in master slave mode and the best part is that it can support multiple slaves so you can have amazing time with friends while flying your drone in air.
