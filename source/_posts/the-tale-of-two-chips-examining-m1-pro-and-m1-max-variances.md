| **Transistors**      | 33.7 billion                     | 57 billion                                          |
| **Memory Bandwidth** | 200 GB/s                         | 400 GB/s                                            |
| **Performance**      | CPU is 70 percent better than M1 | Advanced video editing, powerful graphic processing |

After going through the above comparison table, it is clear that CPU performance is almost the same for both M1 Pro and M1 Max. The actual difference comes in terms of graphical processing, which is much better than M1 Max.

Battery life is almost the same. Though M1 Max takes some advantage over that of M1 Pro, still, M1 Pro performs far better than that of the M1 version.

| **Performance**       | 1.7 times better CPU performance than Intel chips | Good performance for gaming, good processing speed, specific 3D rendering |
| **Transistors**       | 33.7 billion                                      | Approx 7 billion (Not disclosed officially)                               |
| **Memory Bandwidth**  | 200 GB/s                                          | 41.6 GB/s                                                                 |

In terms of CPU performance, battery life, and technology design, there is not much difference between M1 Pro and Intel chips. Though in other areas, there seems to be a particular performance variance. It must say that both of the processors work well in their area.

As a user, you can go with any one of them as per your choice and need. As, both M1 Pro and Intel chips look good in terms of specification and performance.
