5. **Preview:** After making adjustments, review your footage to ensure that the fisheye distortion is adequately corrected. Pay attention to details near the edges of the frame to ensure they look natural.

### Video Speed Adjustment

Video speed adjustment is a crucial tool when it comes to video editing. It allows you to control the pace and timing of your GoPro video, enhancing the storytelling or achieving specific creative effects. To utilize this crucial effect follow the below steps:

1. Choose the clip you want to adjust.
