### Tip 2: Use the Right Hashtag to Reach Your Audience

One of the most common and effective ways to increase followers on any platform is to use the hashtag. No matter if you are working on **kawaii unboxing TikTok** or a technical one, always use the right hashtag. It is like you are taking part in the conversation on social media.

Furthermore, hashtags lead to high user engagement and promote your brand. Therefore, if you have no idea about picking hashtags related to your product, the table mentioned below will help you:

| **Hashtag**        | **Total Views** |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
