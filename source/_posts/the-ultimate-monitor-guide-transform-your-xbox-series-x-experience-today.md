There is a wide selection of gaming monitors out there, and finding the best monitor for Xbox Series X can be tricky. In addition, gaming monitors are a completely new concept for many console owners. It was easy to choose a 4K TV with Xbox One, but we experienced some interesting alternatives when the next generation came along.

As console owners gravitate toward monitors in order to take advantage of the incredible framerates and resolutions the Xbox Series X can deliver, the pull of monitors appears to be increasing. Let's check out some of our top picks for the best monitors for Xbox Series X, and keep in mind that HDMI 2.1 monitors are on the way, so if you're interested in seeing what's coming, please head over to our top picks.

#### **Using a monitor with Xbox Series X**

The best way to enjoy Xbox Series X is to get a monitor that supports either 8K at 60hz or 4K at 120hz, which means that you'll need an HDMI 2.1 monitor. In spite of the fact that there are some amazing HDMI 2.1 cable options out there, HDMI 2.1 monitors are not as common as they could be at this moment, but we expect them to appear soon.

Accordingly, the most common monitor options available for Xbox Series X gamers as of right now are 1080p at 120Hz, 1440p at 120Hz, or 4K at 60Hz. Even though 120hz gaming doesn't require an HDMI 2.1 monitor, one popular approach involves lowering the resolution while increasing framerates. The ability to play either racing or FPS games at 1080p at 120Hz would be an example of this.

**Key Features:**

* **Screen size:** 32 Inches
* Resolution: QHD Wide 1440p
* **Display technology:** QLED
* **Aspect ratio:** 16:9
* **Hardware interface:** HDMI
* **Refresh rate:** 240 Hz
* **Response time:** 1 ms
* **Item weight:**2kg

If you're looking for maximum immersion in gaming, then the Samsung Odyssey G7 is one of the best choices. This computer monitor features a curving screen and a response time of 1 ms, allowing for an immersive gaming experience. The ultra-smooth action is made possible by a 240 Hz refresh rate.

In addition to QLED's lifelike colors, the monitor's curvature lets you fit your peripherals deeper into the game. Besides offering G-Sync and FreeSync compatibility, the Odyssey G7 also has variable external lighting design options.

#### **2\. Gigabyte AORUS 27 Inch Curved Gaming Monitor**

![gigabyte-aorus-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gigabyte-aorus-poster.jpg)

**Key Features:**

If you need a monitor that offers both 1440p and a high refresh rate (165hz in this case), then the Gigabyte AORUS 27 Inch Curved Gaming Monitor is an excellent choice. It features a contrast ratio of 3000:1 and HDR, giving gamers a more immersive and realistic gaming experience. There is no question that this is not a 'budget' monitor, but its design is pretty epic (with LEDs too), and it could work well with a number of different types of games, including fast-paced FPSes as well as upcoming slower and dramatic releases.

#### **3\. ASUS VP28UQG 28 Inch 4K**

![asus-vp28uqg-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-vp28uqg-poster.png)

**Features:**

* **Screen size:** 28 Inches
* **Resolution:** 3840x2160p
* **Display technology:** LCD

* **Hardware interface:** DisplayPort, HDMI, USB 2.0
* **Refresh rate:** 60 Hz
* **Response time:** 1 ms
* **Item Weight:**4 kg
* **Display resolution maximum:** 3840x2160p

With a 60Hz refresh rate and 4K resolution, you'll see great picture quality at a reasonable price when you choose the 60Hz. A 28-inch display makes it possible to enjoy some of the incredible games that come with Series X in a decent cinematic environment.

#### **4\. Acer Nitro XF243Y Pbmiiprx**

![acer-nitro-xf243y-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/acer-nitro-xf243y-poster.jpg)

**Key Features:**

* **Size:** 24"
* **Resolution**: 1920x1080
* **Max Refresh Rate:** 165 Hz
* **Pixel Type:** IPS
* **Variable Refresh Rate:** FreeSync

As far as budget displays go, Acer Nitro XF243Y Pbmiiprx is the best monitor for Xbox Series X that we've tested. The monitor has outstanding motion handling and an excellent 1080p resolution. The stand allows you to adjust the ergonomics and it's decently well-built. There are wide viewing angles on the IPS panel, which makes it easy to see even in bright settings. As a result of its low contrast ratio, it is not suitable for dark rooms.

There are no blur trails behind fast-moving objects because the display is exceptionally responsive, whether you play at 120Hz or 60Hz. Additionally, it has an image duplication-free backlight, which reduces eye strain and reduces eye strain. The variable refresh rate works in a wide range of refresh rates, so even if frame rates are low, you get almost no tearing.

#### **5\. DELL S2721QS**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![dell-s2721qs-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dell-s2721qs-poster.jpg)

**Key Features:**

* **Size:** 27"
* **Resolution:** 3840x2160
* **Max Refresh Rate:** 60 Hz
* **Pixel Type:** IPS
* V**ariable Refresh Rate**: FreeSync

The Dell S2721QS is a great option if you are shopping on a budget. It also has an IPS panel but is an inch smaller than the Acer Nitro XV282K. However, it still offers good response times and VRR support despite its lack of HDMI 2.1 ports and 60Hz refresh rate. Due to its lack of USB ports, and lack of gaming features, the laptop doesn't have many gaming capabilities. However, you do get built-in speakers, and you can also use Picture-in-Picture and Picture-by-Picture to display two input sources simultaneously, ideal for gaming while watching a movie or a show.

Go with the Acer if you can afford it. Due to its higher refresh rate and faster response times, it's a much more efficient gaming monitor. However, if your budget is limited, the Dell would be a good alternative.

#### **Final Verdict**

These are some of our top pics for the best monitors for Xbox Series X. All monitors have different options, and come from different brands. In the end. It all depends upon your requirements and preferences that which monitor you should choose.

* **Resolution:** 3840x2160
* **Max Refresh Rate:** 60 Hz
* **Pixel Type:** IPS
* V**ariable Refresh Rate**: FreeSync

The Dell S2721QS is a great option if you are shopping on a budget. It also has an IPS panel but is an inch smaller than the Acer Nitro XV282K. However, it still offers good response times and VRR support despite its lack of HDMI 2.1 ports and 60Hz refresh rate. Due to its lack of USB ports, and lack of gaming features, the laptop doesn't have many gaming capabilities. However, you do get built-in speakers, and you can also use Picture-in-Picture and Picture-by-Picture to display two input sources simultaneously, ideal for gaming while watching a movie or a show.

Go with the Acer if you can afford it. Due to its higher refresh rate and faster response times, it's a much more efficient gaming monitor. However, if your budget is limited, the Dell would be a good alternative.

#### **Final Verdict**

These are some of our top pics for the best monitors for Xbox Series X. All monitors have different options, and come from different brands. In the end. It all depends upon your requirements and preferences that which monitor you should choose.

There is a wide selection of gaming monitors out there, and finding the best monitor for Xbox Series X can be tricky. In addition, gaming monitors are a completely new concept for many console owners. It was easy to choose a 4K TV with Xbox One, but we experienced some interesting alternatives when the next generation came along.

As console owners gravitate toward monitors in order to take advantage of the incredible framerates and resolutions the Xbox Series X can deliver, the pull of monitors appears to be increasing. Let's check out some of our top picks for the best monitors for Xbox Series X, and keep in mind that HDMI 2.1 monitors are on the way, so if you're interested in seeing what's coming, please head over to our top picks.

#### **Using a monitor with Xbox Series X**

The best way to enjoy Xbox Series X is to get a monitor that supports either 8K at 60hz or 4K at 120hz, which means that you'll need an HDMI 2.1 monitor. In spite of the fact that there are some amazing HDMI 2.1 cable options out there, HDMI 2.1 monitors are not as common as they could be at this moment, but we expect them to appear soon.

Accordingly, the most common monitor options available for Xbox Series X gamers as of right now are 1080p at 120Hz, 1440p at 120Hz, or 4K at 60Hz. Even though 120hz gaming doesn't require an HDMI 2.1 monitor, one popular approach involves lowering the resolution while increasing framerates. The ability to play either racing or FPS games at 1080p at 120Hz would be an example of this.
