In simple words, it refers to a shared virtual platform, which people will be able to access from various devices and where they will be able to move through virtual environments.

The entire concept might be almost a decade away from being completely recognized but it will require the tech giants to cooperate with each other.

In the month of June, Roundhill Investment, the investment firm, had created an ETF, an exchange-traded fund for tracking profit from the work of Metaverse users. Thereafter, Facebook announced its rebranding.

Today, we only have the primitive forerunners of a real Metaverse, Minecraft, Roblox, and other digital user-created worlds. One of the good examples of this idea is Fortnite, a battle royal video game taking place in a large social world. It is an idea as to what some aspects of the Metaverse might look like. Another incredible aspect is the video-conferencing apps. The only difference between this and the actual thing is the real Metaverse is not going to be limited to one game, app, virtual world, or company. It is going to connect them all.

In simple words, it refers to a shared virtual platform, which people will be able to access from various devices and where they will be able to move through virtual environments.

The entire concept might be almost a decade away from being completely recognized but it will require the tech giants to cooperate with each other.

In the month of June, Roundhill Investment, the investment firm, had created an ETF, an exchange-traded fund for tracking profit from the work of Metaverse users. Thereafter, Facebook announced its rebranding.

Today, we only have the primitive forerunners of a real Metaverse, Minecraft, Roblox, and other digital user-created worlds. One of the good examples of this idea is Fortnite, a battle royal video game taking place in a large social world. It is an idea as to what some aspects of the Metaverse might look like. Another incredible aspect is the video-conferencing apps. The only difference between this and the actual thing is the real Metaverse is not going to be limited to one game, app, virtual world, or company. It is going to connect them all.

## Part 2: What Can You Do in the Metaverse?

Here are some great examples of the Metaverse.
