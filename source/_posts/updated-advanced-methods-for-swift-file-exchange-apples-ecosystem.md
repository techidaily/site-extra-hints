## Part 2: How to Send Large Video Files from iPhone to iPhone

### Send files by Dropbox

Dropbox is a cloud-based storage app. It helps in bringing the huge files together in one central space and can be synced with any device safely. It offers several solutions for individuals and teams with various packages.

If you have a Dropbox account, you may send a long video from iPhone to any user, and the best part is that the recipient does not need to have a Dropbox account.

If you don't know whether to use Dropbox or Google Drive, [ll answers are here](https://zapier.com/blog/dropbox-vs-google-drive/).

You can upload it to your Dropbox public folder and then just send the file’s web link to the recipient. If you wish to send a long video from iPhone to people who already have the Dropbox link, whenever you send a new video or file, it can be seen by all in the account making it an easy download instantly.

Thus, working on various official files through a shared folder gives access to all who have the link making the work faster. Offline access, doc scanners, are some other features that make collaboration with people very simple.

### Transfer files with Airdrop

How to send large video files from iPhone using Airdrop? This application’s use is only possible when the person who wishes to send the file or video is near you.

Airdrop uses low energy Bluetooth 4.0 to negotiate, discover, and broadcast connections. The Wi-Fi point to point transfer makes the Airdrop sharing faster, secure, and power-efficient.

Airdrop can share almost everything like photos, passbook passes, videos, contacts, map location, voice memos and whatever you can see on the share sheet.

Few points to note are, you may choose to Airdrop between your contacts or for all. If a person is in your contact, both must be logged into iCloud and if you send it to any random person, you might get prank airdrops.

If the person you wish to send long videos from iPhone has made the Airdrop receiving setting to Contact and you are not in that person’s contact list, make him change the receiving settings to Everyone. Personal hotspot must be turned off and check if the Bluetooth and the Wi-Fi are turned on.
