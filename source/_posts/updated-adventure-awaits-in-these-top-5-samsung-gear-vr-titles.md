 In the changing world of technology, one of the most exciting invention of the present time is the VR gaming. This new technology has completely changed the way games used to be played. You will be all in all in such gaming. A wide variety of genre is available. Here I am going to tell you about the top 5 Samsung Gear VR games that you should try. Below is a table of overview of the games.

 Below here is a brief of each of the game stated in the table.

## [Sky fighter](https://sky-fighter.com/  )

 Sky fighter training day is a free mission of the sky fighters. The context of the game is earth in near future. This is a practice mission. Basically in this game, you will learn the four basis systems of Sky Fighter armor equipped. You need to learn to use propulsion, protection, stabilization and shooting. You need to follow the instructions of the instructor Lt. Rita Velasco. Sky Fighter is a sophisticated armor that is equipped with powerful combats. You need to successfully complete your training without destroying your armor.

 However, if you want to get extra missions, you can get that by buying missions. It is easy but will cost you money. The game has been released on 9th June this year and so far received a mixed reaction. It is suitable for everyone.

## [Spirit Journey](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1188879784477485/  )

 If you are not fond of violating or shooting games and want a peaceful and soothing experience while playing, then Spirit Journey is just the right choice for you. This game is about the journey inside yourself. Through your way, you will find lanterns floating in the air. You have to reach to those lanterns quickly since they will guide you through the drawback of your memories. There are 10 levels in this game and you will have to fight with the gravity as well since this will pull you down the holes. So, be very careful!

 This is a complete non-violent game, requires BT controller or touchpad to play. Indago is the developer of this game and it has been released on 17th of August.
