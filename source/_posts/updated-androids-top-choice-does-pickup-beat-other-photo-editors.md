Furthermore, the app offers numerous filters, a built-in Stickers library, a Frames library, and color-correction tools.

With the **PickU app,** you can create collages, blur your pictures or use the AI cut-out feature to make them more stunning. Also, it has numerous templates (a graphic wallpaper library) to help you change your picture's background with just a single tap.

PickU also has an extensive social sharing feature that allows you to share your pictures on WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and any other social app.

**Disadvantages:** Most users complain that the PickU app often crashes while editing photos, resulting in data loss. Furthermore, the app displays ads while editing pictures which can be annoying. A watermark is also added to your edited picture, which can be removed by watching an ad.
