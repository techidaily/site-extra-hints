1. First of all, open the tool website and sign up. Some tools are paid, and some also provide limited free access.
2. Now you will find two options. Either use any of the existing templates to create a video from scratch or upload your video from your storage. Upload your desired video here.
3. Now find the option to adjust the brightness of your video. All the tools mentioned above will have the option to adjust brightness. All you need to do is find that option, and you are good to go.
4. Once you have found the options, adjust the brightness and contrast of your video to brighten it.
5. Some of these tools will also provide you with different effects that you can apply to your videos. You can also use a good effect to add some luminance to your video.

No matter which tool you are using, just follow these generic steps and you will easily be able to enhance the brightness of your videos.
