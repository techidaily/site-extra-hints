## Part 1\. Steps to Create Animation with Windows Movie Maker

You don't need any technological expertise to produce picture slideshows or home movies with Movie Maker. By using transitions, pan and zoom, and other visual effects, you may give them a more professional appearance and feel. You've decided to create an animated video for your company, so let's get started. Is it still difficult to understand? Be at ease. It's simpler than you would imagine to make an animated video. In this video, we'll go through how to include animations into a Movie Maker project. The Windows Movie Maker instructions for making your own animated movie are listed below.

##### Step1Launch and Add Files in Windows Movie Maker

On your PC, launch Windows Movie Maker. Windows Movie Maker, however, has to be installed on your computer. Select "import photos" in the top right corner. By selecting the "Add movies and photographs" option under the "Home" tab in the navigation bar, you may create films by combining images, sounds, and videos. You may then choose the suitable media to import into the program from a popup that will display.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You have the option to upload one file at a time or many files simultaneously.

##### Step2Go to Edit Menu

If you wish to clip off a section, go to "Edit" under "Video Tools" and choose the "Split" option. Depending on where you place the cursor during the section, the software will divide it into two halves. If you want to remove certain snippets, just touch the clip to reveal the context menu and choose "Remove" or "Delete" from the keyboard.

##### Step3Open the Animation Tab

You may add two distinct types of animations—Transitions and Pan and Zoom—to video clips or photographs using the Animations window on the ribbon. The dropdown menu next to "Speed" in the "Edit" tab may be expanded to change the speed of a video clip.

![animation tab movie maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/animation-tab-movie-maker.jpg)

##### Step4Add Transitions

Between two multimedia portions, a transition effect may be added. In the "Animations" section, there are many different transitions available, including dissolves, patterns, and forms. The transition will be included at the start of the chosen medium. You may alter the effect's duration by writing or choosing a new time frame from the dropdown menu next to "Duration."

##### Step5Save the Video

When a transition is applied, a washed-out diagonal zone on the clip in the timeline indicates where the transition starts and finishes. Additionally, you have a choice in the sequence in which the effects are used. This may change how the movie is finally shown depending on the Effects, you choose. Once you're done, click Apply.
