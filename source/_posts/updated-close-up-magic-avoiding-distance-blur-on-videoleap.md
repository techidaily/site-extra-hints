And from its different tools, zoom is a great function that can be used as a focus tool or can be used as a transition effect.

## How to Animate the Zoom effect in Videoleap

Sometimes the video contents need a dramatic zoom effect that should take place while the video is still playing. And this is called an animated zoom in the Videoleap application. In other words, using the animated zoom effect in Videoleap, you will be able to zoom into your footage. And a major way to apply this effect is by considering the keyframes of the raw footage. These keyframes help the users by animating a zoom effect while there is a movement taking place in the video. And if you also want to animate the zoom effect in Videoleap, here is how you can do it:

* Open the Videoleap application and click on the "+" icon to import files to the application interface. Then you will be available with the video file on a timeline that you want to edit.
* Now, drag the play head on the timeline where you want to start the zoom effect to take place.

![preview timeline videoleap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-timeline-videoleap.jpg)

* Then select the "keyframes" tool from the toolbar at the bottom of your screen.
* Add the keyframes to the desired portion of the video and then navigate the timecode to the place on the timeline where you want to stop it. After that add another keyframe at that point and pinch in to zoom the video.

![add keyframes videoleap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-keyframes-videoleap.jpg)

* Now head to the second time code where you want to focus the subject and then click on it. Then click on the "Preview" icon and see whether it needs further changes.
* When you are satisfied, simply export the project and your animated zoom video will be saved successfully.
