## Pros and Cons of MX and VLC Player

 The list of pros includes many similar kind of offers; they are described as:

**_Pros:_**

* Both of them follow hardware integration.
* Offer wide range of customization possibilities for user platforms.
* VLC as well as MX extends support to subtitle formats.
* They offer multi support decoding facility.
* Multiple languages are supported for subtitles.
* Both these players support most of the video file formats.
* The audio tracks can be altered dynamically as per need.

 The added advantage to VLC platform is that it handles all media files with smooth processing whereas handy widgets make home screen controls much easier. You can easily manage all media files in its playlist with easy search options.

 MX Player possesses wide range of advanced services like pinch to zoom and it also offers subtitle movement options.

**_Cons:_**

 If you plan to switch to free version of MX player then you will have to tolerate loads of ads. The only option to get rid of these ads is to pay for the professional version that has additional advanced features. The pro version can definitely ensure high quality content delivery without causing unwanted clutters on screen.

 The only difficulty that you can face with VLC player is that its beta version is not much stable but it is not a big issue for android user because the new update is quite stable and performs better. You will not find pop ads on VLC like MX player.

 One more big difference between VLC and MX is that VLC can assist users in easy network streaming whereas MX lacks in this capability.

### The User Interface

 Users reviews say that the first appearance of MX player is not so impressive and do not even contain a well designed menu area that is popular in case of VLC. But one must say that MX is perfect choice if you want to stay focused with video content delivery. Other than annoying ads, you will not find any other distraction on its interface.

 In case of VLC, you can definitely enjoy finest screen controls with well managed search menu and it also offers refresh options to stay tuned with updated library. Users can easily switch between audio and video files over VLC.

### Viewing Media

 It is really difficult to prove that any one of these players perform better in terms of viewing media category. Both of these offer great content delivery but you can put VLC on higher side just because of its ability to play videos without cluttering screen with ads. MX keeps on distracting users with so many ads that can even cover your desired video content on screen. You need to make payment to get pro version of MX that is free from ads but VLC is always free with loads of quality features.

### Extra Features

 Developers often keep on improving their media player software with advanced features so that viewers can enjoy incredible experience. But in case of VLC you will find least modifications and it appears same from so many years. This tool is just fine for basic users if you don’t expect additional stuff.

 On the other side, MX player can serve your video watching needs in better manner with added features. Its lock screen feature can keep kids out of control and gesture control feature enables users to enjoy easy controls over brightness and volume.

 One more interesting thing to note about MX player is its advanced hardware integration. However, both these systems offers satisfactory services but still the constant updates on platform features make things more useful.

### Support

 You will be able to avail great support service from developers online; it is possible to connect via chat with real support assistant and you can avail fast solutions for all troubles. But you may have to wait too long to get connected with support team as MX player forum stays too busy.

 There is no doubt to say that VLC is much better option in terms of support service. You can stay connected to information via forum, Wiki, well designed troubleshooting guide and FAQs. The dedicated service team of VLC can provide you instant solution for all troubles.

## Conclusion

 Both of these media players are capable enough to play almost all popular media file formats and ensure optimal content quality for music as well as video files.

 Most of the users love to play all media files on VLC while working on computer whereas MX player is rated as best solution for android platform. Those who cannot tolerate annoying ads on screen are advised to go ahead with VLC and the second option is to spend on professional version of MX player. But if you are okay with ads then free version of MX player is also a good choice. However, the paid version can provide your easy access to wide range of advanced player features.
