## Adobe Meme Templates

If you are looking to create unique and high-quality memes, Adobe Express is one of the best tools to use. This is an online photo editing tool from Adobe that can be used to generate memes very easily. While you can use Adobe Express to create a meme from scratch, the easiest way to create a meme is to choose from the numerous templates on the site.

![adobe meme templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adobe-meme-templates.jpg)

Once you choose a template, you can use Adobe Express to make changes to the template in various ways. This photo editor has a lot of features to help you make changes to the meme including editing the photos by replacing them with your images, editing the text by changing the font, and even changing the size of the entire meme.

The only problem with the meme templates that you find on Adobe Express is that they are not very well arranged. The home page is a list of templates of various genres and themes and you may find that it is quite a chore to find the unique template that you would like to use.

## Knowledge of Meme Templates

**1\. Copyright of Free Meme Templates**

Like every other type of content that you may see online, memes (even free meme templates) are copyrighted. But the reason you don’t hear about this is that meme copyright infringement is rarely enforced. Memes are relatively easy to create and cost next to nothing so pursuing litigation in copyright infringement may not be worth the cost. They are also widely available and it is difficult to figure out where they originated from.

If you are worried about the legal implications of using a free meme template, you can credit the creator of the meme whenever you use it. But because it can often be difficult to find out who created the meme, this may be very difficult. The only way to overcome these legal challenges may be to use some of the meme templates on this page to create your own meme that will be unique to you.

**2\. Trending Meme Topics**

You may notice that memes constantly change and a meme that was popular yesterday, may not be very popular today. The following are some of the top trending meme topics recently;

* Prince Louis at the Queen’s Birthday in June
* Megan Thee Stallion and Cara Delevingne in May 2022
* The YouTuber Emma Chamberlain at the Met Gala in May
* Bridgerton Memes in March 2022
* Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker (Kravis) in Vegas
* Euphoria Season 2’s release
* Superbowl Halftime Show Memes
* Zoom Virtual Meeting fails
* Facebook becoming Meta
* Kim Kardashian at the Met Gala

**3\. Famous Meme Templates**

If your goal is to grab some attention with your memes, you may want to consider the following most famous meme templates of all time;

**_Drake Hotline Bling_**

This meme of Drake doing his now world-famous hotline bling dance moves went viral in 2015 and had continued to be popular today. This meme still turns heads and is still one of the best ways to get a reaction from your audience.

![drake hotline bling](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/drake-hotline-bling.jpg)

**_Surprised Pikachu_**

Pikachu is famous in his own right, so it wasn’t very surprising when the meme of a very surprised Pikachu went viral. The expression applies to so many situations, it became the perfect way to exclaim or appear surprised or even express outrage in one way or another.

![surprised pikachu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/surprised-pikachu.jpg)

**_Awkward Look Monkey Puppet_**

This meme template became very useful in several ways because of the monkey’s expression that can be applied to just about any situation. Suddenly, the awkward monkey was popping up everywhere especially on Twitter as a comment or a post.
