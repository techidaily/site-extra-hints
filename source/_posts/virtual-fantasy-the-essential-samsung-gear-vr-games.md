You will be all in all in such gaming. A wide variety of genre is available. Here I am going to tell you about the top 5 Samsung Gear VR games that you should try. Below is a table of overview of the games.

 Below here is a brief of each of the game stated in the table.

## [Sky fighter](https://sky-fighter.com/  )

## [Spirit Journey](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1188879784477485/  )

 If you are not fond of violating or shooting games and want a peaceful and soothing experience while playing, then Spirit Journey is just the right choice for you. This game is about the journey inside yourself. Through your way, you will find lanterns floating in the air. You have to reach to those lanterns quickly since they will guide you through the drawback of your memories. There are 10 levels in this game and you will have to fight with the gravity as well since this will pull you down the holes. So, be very careful!

## [Dark Days](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1063691710368492/  )
