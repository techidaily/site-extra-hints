This simple and easy to use application which comes with a rather overstuffed interface would give the users plenty of tools for zooming in and changing the size of any given image.

![phpoto zoom pro7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photozomm-pro7-step2.jpg)

 The next thing you need to do is set the size of the resulting image. For this you need to set the resolution, height, width and aspect ratio for the picture. Now you need to select the new resolution and size of the picture and the software would automatically enlarge the picture for you. The navigation box on the top left of the application would allow the users to preview all the various parts of the image.

#### Step 3: Selecting the resize method for resizing the picture

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![phpoto zoom pro7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photozomm-pro7-step3.jpg)

 Now that you have set the desired height width and resolution of the picture, the next thing you need to do is choose a resize method for resizing the picture. The Photo Zoom Pro 7 app makes you of the S-Spline resize method by default. However the user is allowed to select from as many as 11 different resize methods such as S- Spline Max, Bicubic, Lanczos and many more. Each preset has a number of options with which you can tweak the resulting image.

 Apart from them you will also get a batch processing mode which allows you to resize the image folders. This app works great with iPhoto libraries as well. Out of all the available presets S-Spline Max is surely your best option since it gives you resized pictures which are good to look at.
